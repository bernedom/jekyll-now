**What is your organisations currency of getting things done?** Every organisation has those people who seem just to be more able than the rest to get things moving. Others struggle massively to get their concerns put into action. The reason is probably not, that the concerns of one group of people is more valuable than this of others, but that some people just "bribe" with the more valuable arguments to get things done. 

Every company or organisation has some form of killer-argument that gets projects started when they fall to the right ears. Be it a fancy new innovation project or some internal process optimisation. Once the right words are dropped into the right ears things move almost by themselves. I call this the "currency of getting things done". Paying a small amount in the right currency is often more worth, than investing a huge effort in an inflated one. 

## Different currencies 

There are many different currencies around, some of the more common ones are 
* **Urgency**: Things are only moving if it's really urgent and failure to act **now** has dire consequences
* **Follow the plan**: If there is no plan, there is no action. And once there is a plan we follow it strictly
* **Innovation**: It's new! It's shiny! It's the latest hype. We don't do old, dusty stuff here
* **Importance**: Doing this at any time, even in the far future is important. Failing to do so will bite us back
* **Hierarchy**: What is said is not so much important as from which box in the organigram it came from or who said it first
* **Momentum and inertia**: It might not be the brightest idea, but hey we're already on the move here. Danger of the sunk cost fallacy 

Of course there are many more and nuances between the "big ones". The more equal the different currencies the more diverse the things that a company can accomplish. The more imbalanced the more skewed and one-sided are the kind of actions a company can do and the less wholesome the overall climate tends to be. "Spending power" towards these currencies is often directly influenced by the role or position a person fullfills in a company. An R&D departement naturally deals mostly in the *innovation* currency while sales often is high on *urgency*. Consequently certain people might find themselves unable to spend anything in a certain currency. An emergency service or first responders are usually almost unable to pay in *follow the plan* when their executing their core business, which is overcoming chaotic incidents. 

## A healthy economy

A company with a healthy internal economy of getting things done is a) keenly aware of the current exchange rates and b) there is no currency dominating all the time. Of course depending on the cicrumstances one currency can become the main way of buying change for a while. For instance during the end-of-the-year-delivery-rush of a hardware supplier **urgency** probably becomes a much higher quotation than innovation, but as soon as this is done a healthy company is able to quickly equalize the market again. 

Realizing what the underlying real value of the currencies in use is, is a first step to be able to equalize the market. Is *innovation* dominating because the organisation is trying to open new markets for its products? *Hierarchy* might profit from a military-like command and control structure and *follow the plan* gets boosted from general risk aversion and long planning cycles. Knowing the underlying values will help giving a hint of wheter a currency is over-inflated or too strong. If the relation of the currencies and the base value does not correspond, one is often left with the feeling that either the wrong reasons were made or that at least the reason for the decision making where wrong. 


| Currency        | Examples base values                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Urgency         | Fast markets, too big workload or too many things work in progress, error-prone processes (i.e constant firefighting)    |
| Follow the plan | Long and detailed planning horizons, risk aversion, more-of-the-same work, predictability of the work done               |
| Innovation      | Opening new markets, Fast living products, constant reinventing of the organisation                                      |
| Importance      | Sustainability of operations, slow paced and stable market, low pressure from competition                                |
| Hierarchy       | Rigid structures, dominant leaders/managers, one-sided importance of different departments and people, roles equal power |
| Momentum        | Pressure to deliver, strong strategies, sunk cost fallacy, binding budgets, low failure tolerance                        |
*Examples of currencies and possible base values*

Balancing these underlying values often proves to have more leverage than just influencing the currency directly.

## Put it into practice 

THe analogy of buying power for ideas and decisiosn of course only goes so far. But being able to recognize the mechanics of "how things get done here" will help to more self awareness as an organization which in turn will be a good step to improve.
