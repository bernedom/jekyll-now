**What is your organisations currency of getting things done?** Every organisation has those people who seem just to be more able than the rest to get things moving. Others struggle massively to get their concerns put into action. The reason is probably not, that the concerns of one group of people is more valuable than this of others, but that some people just "bribe" with the more valuable arguments to get things done. 

Every company or organisation has some form of killer-argument that gets projects started when they fall to the right ears. Be it a fancy new innovation project or some internal process optimisation. Once the right words are dropped into the right ears things move almost by themselves. I call this the "currency of getting things done". Paying a small amount in the right currency is often more worth, than investing a huge effort in an inflated one. 

## Different currencies 

There are many different currencies around, some of the more common ones are 
* **Urgency**: Things are only moving if it's really urgent and failure to act **now** has dire consequences
* **Follow the plan**: If there is no plan, there is no action. And once there is a plan we follow it strictly
* **Innovation**: It's new! It's shiny! It's the latest hype. We don't do old, dusty stuff here
* **Importance**: Doing this at any time, even in the far future is important. Faililng to do so will bite us back
*
