**A coach can set a direction of change but the speed of it's implementation is out of his/her hands.** Helping people transforming their organisations and teams as a coach is one of the most interesting things I've done in the last years. It is also one of the most frustrating things at times. Getting people to change the way they work together and having them shift their attitudes to work in general is complex and hard work and it is often only after some time that the effects of such a transformation can be seen. For a coach one of the biggest pitfalls when accompanying such a transformation is to fall into the pip of impatience. 

The more time one has spent coaching the bigger the danger of becoming to impatient. Also if you're a hired gun as a coach you're likely under some pressure from the people paying your bills to "get there quickly"
