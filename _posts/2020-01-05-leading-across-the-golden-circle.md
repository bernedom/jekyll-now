title: Leading across the golden circle

In modern, sociocratic organizations there is not a single leader, but more situational leadership. Whoever "knows best" leads the way. In the book [Start with Why](https://simonsinek.com/product/start-with-why/?ref=home), the author Simon Sinek describes what he calls the "golden circle" consisting of three concentric rings, "Why", "How" and "What". The golden circle is a very good tool to describe "purpose" of what is getting done. This is important, as having a purpose is a great incentive to get things done. 

But the questions of "Why", "How", "What" often do not get answered out of thin air. Especially for more complex matters there is often a quite complicated social dynamic at work and very often the people involved are looking for leadership figures to help them answer the questions. In traditional companies this was usually the manager or boss, but as we strife to more sociocratic organizational forms and as knowledge work increases it is very unlikely that there exists a single person bringing all the necessary knowledge and expertise to the table to call the shots (and achieves a good result) across the whole span of the problem. Situational leadership is the answer, so depending on what question(s) we're trying to answer, a different skill set for leading is needed. There are of course lots of leadership skills such as strong communication skills that are transient for all areas.

## Leading the 'Why' 

At the core of any problem lies the "why". Why are we even doing what we doing sounds philosophical, but teams and organizations that can answer this question satisfactorily tend to display more higher motivation and better alignment between individuals to solve the problem. Finding the answer is often tricky and in order to lead such an answering process a leader has to display **content expertise** often also called **domain knowledge** about the subject at hand. By this is do not mean knowing all the nitty gritty detail of a possible implementation or solution, but having a deeper understanding of the **problem context**. In companies this can be knowledge about the market or users or being the driver behind a [good company vision]({{site.base_url}}/a-good-product-vision/). In small companies and startups this is often, but not necessarily one of the founders, in bigger more taylorism-like companies and large firms this knowledge often lies with middle to upper management. 

Important is that whoever can bring the necessary background information needs to be not just involved in the discussion, but also able to lead this. 

## Leading the 'How'

Once the "why" is fairly established bringing up the "how" - often in the form of a plan and methods - is the next to solve. Naturally whoever emerges as a leader in this part has to have a good method competence and process knowledge to formulate such a plan. Typical questions here are who to bring on board at what point, how to facilitate communication and breaking down the big "Why"-problems into smaller chunks. Leading the how has high demands on facilitation skills as well, because defining the how often raises more questions that help sharpening the "why" on one side and the "how" sets constraints on the "what" i.e. the implementation. Leading the how has often a more managerial component than leading the other two circles. 

## Leading the 'What' 

Here one gets down to business and gets the hands dirty with actually implementing things. Leading this part of course needs close collaboration an awareness about the "Why" and "What" but even more so it needs expertise and specialist knowledge. Finding the right solution to the problems posed requires an in-depth knowledge of the mechanics involved. The main task of the "what" is finding and implementing solutions, so a leader of the "what@ should be able to sketch out a feasible solution to the problem and be able to hold a critical dialog about the implementation details of it. 
Ideally leading the implementation means being placed into a tight feedback loop for observing if the actions taken are having the desired effect. If such a feedback loop does not exist yet or is too weak building them for the people working on the what is an essential task here. 

## Who can do that? 

The bigger the problems and issues faced, the less likely it is that one single person can lead across the whole circle, but having people who can at least partially take leadership in the different rings is a big plus. The borders between the rings are fuzzy and thinking in one ring will affect the others as well, so creating artificial borders or even stage gates between the three is a bad idea. Frequent "broadband" communication on an eye-level across all rings is essential. But being aware that the different questions require a different credibility in different areas of knowledge will help driving the the acceptance of solutions in the people affected by any change. Being able to explicitly state in which rings a discussion takes place and being aware what kind of knowledge has the most weight here will help finding the right people to lead or building the missing skills to bring change about.
