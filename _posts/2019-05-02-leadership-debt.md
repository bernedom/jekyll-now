**In the future we need few managers, but lots of leaders.** Countless companies and organizations are currently changing how they work internally. Some experience a growth spurt in the wake of digitalisation, others want to be more flexible in reacting to change. And a lot of these organizations struggle with these transformations. They got the agile framework of their choosing in place, they got the teams set up and maybe they even streamlined their portfolio and technological infrastructure to be easy to adapt to changes. At first everything looks good, but after a while all the new shining things start to lose their gleam and things become tedious again. Decisions still take ages to be put into action and once a course is set people find it hard to deviate from it. Not to mention all the fluffy stuff like empowerment of the teams and people, that somehow does not seem to happen. These symptoms might hint at what I call "leadership debt". 

When companies change, people often find themselves in new places inside and organization. Be it the former senior engineer suddenly finding himself in a role as a team-leader, or the former project manager now being called release train engineer and being responsible for large level process execution. Or even the CEO seeing herself no longer as the top generalissimo, but as a facilitator for putting the company vision into a strategy. Whatever the shift is, often people find themselves in new leadership roles that demand different behavior than before. After all the "old" behavior is what got the company to the place where changing it was inevitable. However if the leadership behavior is no longer adequate for the new situation leadership debt will occur and the performance of an organization will be eroded down over time. 

# Leadership debt - what is it

In software engineering there is the concept of technical debt. Essentially it means that parts of existing code has to be rewritten at a later stage either because of rising complexity and deteriorating structures in the program. The code might have been OK in the past, but changing circumstances or technical developments have changed that so that it is no longer adequate. If such debt is accepted consciously and the interest is regularly paid in the form of maintaining and modernizing the code-base that is not that much of a problem. The problems start if the engineers are not aware that they entered such a debt. Then the interest to be paid silently amasses until one day, the debtful part of a program has to be changed - payday arrived. And this is usually very expensive and disrupting to the daily business. 

The same concept can be applied to leadership. Past behavior can suddenly become inadequate because of changing circumstances. As a consequence the resulting decisions and policies suddenly do not fit the situation anymore. The same as in software, if the leaders are aware of this and are able to change their behavior and adapt their policies and decisions, not much of a problem. Again the dangerous thing is, if the interest amasses silently and payday arrives suddenly. Ever heard of whole teams quitting suddenly quitting all at once? That might be a sign of failure to pay off hidden leadership debt.

It is almost impossible to avoid such debt completely in an evolving environment. What yesterday worked might be obsolete today. The way people were led a few years ago might look antiquated by now. What is needed are structures and processes that make this debt visible as soon as possible and then allow the people to tackle this. In software engineering we call these processes, skills and structures "DevOps"[^1]. 

Unfortunately leadership debt is even less tangible than technical debt and its effect often have a much longer delay. Lack of hard facts and temporal dissonance makes it very hard to recognize leadership debt. 

# Avoiding paying the interest 

Competent leaders are necessary in modern organizations and even more so if that organization is undergoing a transformation. As changing the organizational DNA often forces an organization to internally realign itself, somebody has to take over the lead in figuring out the direction to go. So it is natural, that people are looking for leaders that are driving such change. It is noteworthy that there often is a distinct leader in a certain situation, but that is not necessarily always the same person for each situation. In an unstructured social setting such leaders often emerge spontaneously through conversation and behavior, but in a company people are often attributed to roles which consequently fosters an expectation an who is leading. A word of warning: Avoid assuming that just because a person is fulfilling a certain role he or she is automatically good at leading (or even aware of the implied leadership). 

Bad leadership in business can have many consequences and comes in many forms. Be it the inability to make meaningful decisions in time, people leaving the organization as a consequence of bad leadership or the inability to motivate people to work in the same direction, all bad leadership leads to an erosion of the performance of an organization as a whole until it no longer functions as intended. This can be a symptom of leadership debt. Typically it is not one big event leading to that state, but a many small mistakes and wrong assumptions in leadership that accumulates. 

It is possible to minimize the amount of debt incurred, but avoiding it completely is almost impossible. So the focus is not primarily in avoiding leadership debt, but rather in being able to pay the interest back as quickly as possible. The same as in software engineering, training people and encouraging constant learning is a very good start. This is especially true for people inexperienced in acting as leaders. 

Leading people is not something that can be learned over night or even with a two day course in "Leadership 101" - unfortunately looking at a lot of companies this seems to be exactly what is assumed. Few people can perform in a leadership function naturally, for most of us a very steep learning curve awaits to become good at leading and inspiring people. Formal training helps, but strong leaders acquire their competence through constant and active reflection and learning-by-doing. Even better if leaders are not just reflecting for themselves, but receive honest and critical feedback from others. Unfortunately lots of organizations lack the practice to apply such feedback to their leaders and are further hampered by structures that make giving feedback harder. Consciously creating structures and mechanisms that foster constant feedback and learning are the most important things for avoiding leadership debt in an organization. This starts with a culture where **people give and receive critical, but constructive feedback daily**. 
Getting honest feedback is important for all people, but as leaders are key figures in an organization, for them being in a good feedback loop is worth even more.

# First steps to become debt-free

As each organization has its own context there is no "guaranteed to work"-recipe to minimize leadership debt, but the following measures are often a very good starting point. 

The first action that is often needed, is getting out of the rat race and creating time to think, contemplate and nurture thoughts about each individuals own action. If people, especially leaders are under constant time pressure, the necessary learning circles will not take hold. A simple way to do this is not to plan meetings back to back, to take a breather in between. Having a few minutes or a quarter of an hour downtime is often already a good enough to allow people - especially those expected to lead - to collect their thoughts. Encourage people to sometimes spend an hour somewhere quiet with just a piece of paper and a pen to think and take notes.

Being on the look out who the leaders are and being able to recognize them is another crucial part and an often overlooked missing piece of the puzzle - especially in organizations that are actively transforming themselves. People often associate leadership with a certain role or management-function, but to find true leaders one has often look beyond such roles and titles. When observing how people work together and interact on a daily basis ones can often find inherent leaders skills in unexpected places. 
The big benefit of these "hidden gems" is often that they evolved naturally through unstructured social interaction and thus often have a very broad acceptance in their peers. Encouraging these natural leaders to actively exert their leadership skills can help mitigating the leadership debt in a short time. Making them role models or even mentors for leadership can bring a long term benefit as well. 

Identifying good leaders and having the thinking time enables nurturing the practice of mentoring and coaching in an organisation. Not just for leaders but for everybody. The high performers should do daily hands-on coaching and mentoring of other peoples. This might come at the price of sacrifcing short term gains for long term sustainability, but the price is often well worth it. 
It is of course not just the mentors who need time of their backs, also make room for the mentees in their day-to-day work to receive the coaching. External coaches can be a great help, but they carry the risk one becomes too dependent on external people to combat leadership-debt. 

All that building and distributing of leadership skills needs strong feedback culture. Building it up needs time, but training people in how to give and receive feedback is a very good first step. Having a common understanding what is meant by "feedback" and that is different from criticism or scolding people is essential to build a good feedback culture. Encourage people to give feedback regularly, not just when something goes bad, but also when things are coming along well. 

Building successful leadership by making time, enabling feedback and finding the right people is hard and complex work, but the rewards are huge. Recognizing that one might suffer from leadership debt is often the first step towards getting rid of it. As with technical debt, leadership debt will never be completely avoidable but if it is being recognized and the interest is paid up front, later costs can be greatly reduced.
