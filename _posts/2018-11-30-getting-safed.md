**SAFe is the worst implementation of "corporate agile" that is out there!** Over the last few months I heard this sentence or a variety of it quite a few time. I also said it a few times as well. The [SAFe-framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com) is far from what I call "agile", but it has a few good things as well. So it is worth to have a more differentiated look at it. 

# Getting SAFed 

Over the lasts few months I had the opportunity to be on the receiving end of a professionally conducted transition of SAFe of a departement in a large, multinational company. This implementation of the scaled agile framework was led by a very experienced coach from a distinguished consulting company, so I had the luck of seing experts at work here. I was - and remain - quite skeptical about the SAFe-framework, but I decided to [take me by own words)[{{site.base_url}}/agile-beyond-team-size/] to help to make it a success and in the meantime getting a good look at how this is working out.
