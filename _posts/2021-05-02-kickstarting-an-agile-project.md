title: Kickstarting an agile project
description: Agile software development is the way to go when developing a project. But how does one get started with a project or a product? What is needed to get an initial backlog up and running and how much information should one collect to enable all people involved to act empowered?

**Agile is all fun and games when the team is up and running, but how does one start an agile software product development.** The term "agile software development" is around for 15+ years by now and there is lots of information about how to run a team and iterate over the backlog. Be it with scrum, kanban or any other flavor of an agile process. But how does one begin with an agile project even when the teams and the organization is already geared towards agile and knows how to do "agile", what first steps to take to deliver a running start? Over the years I found that spending a few days figuring out the basic premises, constraints and the ultimate goal of a product are time well spent and are a great enabler for a team to create an awesome product. 

!!! TODO GRAFIK DISCOVERY PHASE !!!

The whole goal of these first days is to create an understanding about the context and goal of the product in order to give the implementing people enough information to foster autonomy and alignment about what we are to do. The context consists of the product vision, an overview over the affected stakeholder groups and a prioritization of the desired quality goals. 

From this information it is often comparatively easy to create a first story map and then distill a very minimal walking skeleton from it, which is all we need to start coding. Usually I get all this information from spending one or two days with the project sponsors. 

## Project vision - why is this worth developing

The first thing to understand when starting a new software project or taking over an existing one is the vision behind it. This includes not just where do we intend to go, but more importantly, WHY do we want to go there? Finding out what the driving force behind a product in development is helps a lot later when the backlog needs prioritization. At this point I usually just let my customer talk and then drill down a bit using the [five why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) technique while taking a copious amount of notes. A big part of that is also to switch the view from the product provider to the product user and as "why would I want to use that product." Most of the time I leave it at that, but if the answers are not conscise enough investing the time to create a [value proposition canvas](https://vimeo.com/201197034) is usually well invested time. 

## Stakeholder map - Who is involved

Ok, so we have a rough idea where we want to go with the product, but let's have a look at who benefits from the project. Very often I see the stakeholders just grouped together als "our users" or "our customers" and it is rarely that easy. 


1. Project vision - Why does our client (or we) want to create that product?  What is the deeper motivation? what is the business case? How does it fit with the strategy of the organization? 5 Whys, "Just let them talk"
2. Stakeholders who is involved - Stakeholder map, get finer than "user", "customer" etc. identify core processes
3. Quality attributes - How do we define "quality"? Which attributes are the most important for product success? On which can we not clamp down without compromising the project. Where do we spend extra effort? 
4. Story mapping over the whole base use case up until decommissionig
5. Walking skeleton, what do we need to validate that this is basically working
6. GO!
