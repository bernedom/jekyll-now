**"What is the estimate on that story?"** A question that makes many a developer sweat. Estimation of work is one of the highly controversial - and often misinterpreted- topics of the agile world. There are few topics that get so much attention and discussion as estimation. The standpoints could often not be further apart. Developers who refuse to give any estimation on the basis that they are not exact enough and classically trained managers unable to bring a plan further without an in-depth estimation of work often clash even in organization that otherwise do pretty well when it comes to agility. 

The desire to have future work estimation is a real one even if not all people agree on the value of it. There is the #NoEstimates movement and if an organization supports it that is awesome. The reality is however often that some form of estimation has to be done at one point or another, even in functioning agile processes. Putting the discussion what the main benefit of estimation should or should not be, the resulting quantity is often used to plan ahead. 

A pattern I've seen quite many times is that POs claim to not be able to prioritize backlogs without such an estimation. The same people wanting an exact number for estimations fail to name the value of a story beforehand. And by value I do not necessarily mean amount of cash paid. Simply put value is "what we want (right now)". And there lies the biggest leverage to successful product delivery. Knowing "What we want" is what has to come first, before any slicing, any technical spikes, any estimation. 

When comparing successful with unsuccessful product-deliveries over the last years, almost all successful ones knew what they wanted from the start, while the unsuccessful ones had lots of ambiguity and no open dialog over value. 

So if you need to do estimation, do it last in the process!



True in the end we would like only to do all those small, but valuable stories to maximize output, but reality is often a different one. Once in a while there comes this big task that just needs to be done without any immediate benefit and that just feels like slogging on.
