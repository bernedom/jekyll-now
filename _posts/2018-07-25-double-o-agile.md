title: Double-O-Agile: You need James Bond in your company

---

**The core capital of modern companies are their employees**. Especially for the companies operating in areas that require highly trained and motivated people with a high degree on initiative. A lot of tech companies, especially if they are specialising in writing software, fit perfectly into that scheme. The combination of skill, motivation, aligment and initiative is what I like to call the "James Bond" package. The most famous of all secret agents possesses all these traits and a good measure of social skills, which is why he is so successful in saving the world. 

# The James Bond Package

So what makes the James-Bond package so appealing? 

# Alignment and Autonomy

Modern company culture that follow the agile mindset requires not just on a good distribution of skills ind their employees but also relies heavily on alignment and autonomy of teams and individuals. By finding and increasing automomy but retaining alignment the foundation of high individual initiative is laid. Something that every secret agent needd, because removing the autonomy from the secret agents keeps them from utilizing their skills to the maximum. James Bond's Boss Who goes by the secret callsign M realizes that and shows it more than once by telling 007 to solve a problem "No matter how". 
Now this would be inherently dangerous if M's favorite killing machine would be missing the alignment that puts some implicit constraints around "No matter how". Mr. Bond is heavily aligned with the survival and prosperity of the western world and Great Brintain in particular so he will not willingly sacrifice british interests in pursuing his mission. While the goal and motive of our company is probably something different it would be great if all our employees would align with it and work towards that goal on their own. Of course our situation is often less dramatic than that of MI-6 but, we're also not set out to save the world in a hollywood manner. 

Creating alignment is no mean feat, but a good starting ground is to explicitely state the mission of each team. The more each individual can identify with this mission the higher the alignment is, as this is heightening intrinsic motivation. It is no conincidence that the main plot of almost every James Bond movie starts with the secret agent sitting in the bureau of M and recieving his mission. Most of the time 007 does not just get a Mission, but also reasoning behind why this mission is of utter importance. For hollywood this serves to create context for the plot but also as a hook to pull the audience into the story. This displays three actions which a company should do in order to create alignment. First explicitely state - and explain - their mission internally to turn their employes into litte James Bonds and then state that mission to the outside world - for instance to customers - so they can get a buy in. does

The second thing that M does at the beginning of each mission is to state very loose constraints and principles for acting on the famous secret agent. The most famous constraint of course being that the mission is to remain "top secret" from the public. As a sidenote it is interesting to see that the villain - aka your companies competition - usually is very well informed about the mission. However M does not explain in-depth on what "top secret" means or how 007 has to act to keep the matter private. M trusts James Bond to act accordingly when going on a mission and thus creating the autonomy needed for this.

Of course the famous secret agent oversteps the constraints or violates one of the principles once a movie - and promptly gets told off by M. Frequently adjusting the aligment and reflecting back on the autonomy is a very essentialy thing to do. After all if the alignement goes astray, the hero might turn into the villain, as displayed a former double-O agnet turned evil played by Sean Bean in Goldeneye. But instead of telling James Bond how he should have handled things, M ist content with telling him that the results - or lack thereof - were not as expected or that the means to achieve them were not appropriate (often resulting in spectacular collateral damage). James Bond is left on his own devices to reflect on that information and adapt or change his methods to get back to what was expected.  This translates very well into the world of self-organizing, empowered teams and individuals that are proclaimed by the agile mindset. If people have the power to change themselves and are expected to do so, it is very likely that they will do so. 

# Skills and training

But why does James Bond gets that much autonomy? One reason is because he is highly skilled. From Diving, over Parachuting and driving a tank to playing high-stakes-poker: James Bond mastered all these and many more skills. Of course being a hollywood superman he is highly capable, but all the ability would be nothing without proper training. The tedious and long routines of aquiring difficult skills at a high level of compentence never made it to the screen, but it is obvious that 007 has ample time to learn new skills and hone old ones. Just the fact that he more or less keeps on top of modern technology and changed social norms for over 50 years make this obvious. This displays another key benefit of allowing your employees to learn new things and perfect or modernize existing skills. When doing so, people tend to stay longer with a company and thus keep key knowledge in the company. Especially for companies that rely on knowledge workers this is a huge benefit. 

Training people meas that one has to allow for enough slack time, so people can recharge their batteries and improve themselves. A lot of companies display great difficulty in getting their employees continously trained beyond what is required by the organisational health and safety standards. Quite often companies postpone the training of their employees to "later" or leave it entirely to the employe to tackle this in their free time. 
On average MI-6 (Or the producers of the movie) send James Bond only on missions every 2 to 3 years. The rest of the time he spends relaxing and training. It is even mentioned in some movies that even the double-O agents need to pass certain tests and qualifications to keep their status, which is just fair considered how much power they wield. Of course it is in MI-6s interest that the double-O agents actually pass their certification, not just because they are critical to the worlds survival, but also because their training is probably a quite large monetary investment from the british government. It is very likely that MI-6 does not leave its employees on their own when training new skills by providing necessary training opportunities such as organizing a handful of military jets or the latest prototypes out of Q's laboratory.

# Supporting infrastructure and services

It's not just the skills that set 007 apart from his counterparts. An often critical part of his success lies in the ingenious inventions of Q and his fellow technicians. No James Bond movie would be complete without the famous James Bond cars and the other small but helpful gadgets from MI-6s inventors. Oftentimes it is exactly these inventions that allow James Bond to survive and otherwise unescabable situation. 
Of course the inventions themselves are brilliant, but even more brilliant is the way how Q is supplying them to 007. Q and his team are masters at anticipating the needs of secret agents in a pinch. They usually come up with a solution before James Bond even knows about the problem he might face. And all this without asking for a budget once. This in itself shows that Qs organisation works on a very high understanding of their customers daily work, but it also shows that James Bond can draw from a very well organised and powerful organisational support. It greatly enhances the effectiveness of James Bond that he does not have to seek out the responsible person and ask permission every time he needs a new gadget. But not just technical support is given, there is also a great organisational and administrative support going on. All the plane tickets, clothing and rental cars and contacts to foreign secret services miraclously appear whenever needed. While this is often displayed as James Bond charming Miss Monneypenny, she is just the face on the forefront of a large, very supportive administrative force.

Nevertheless a lot of companies fail to facilitate the autonomy and aligment and as a consequence they require to create explicit rules and constraints for working and a heavy reliance on controlling to enforce these.

Even more dangeraously if the alignment is missing, secret agents turn into villains, as displayed by Sean Bean in Goldeneye. 007 

The villain agent Alex(?), played by Sean Bean is not just an example of alignment gone ﻿astray, but also of failed recognition of his skills and achievements. In one of the key scenes (Link) he explains that "he got tired of fixing his Majesties Mistakes for Handshake and a 'well done' from M". 
While his ulterior motive remains vague the rage and subsequent quest for revenge on everything that that James Bond stands for make it clear that he

What would james bond do? 
James Bond - the perfect agile developer

* Einleitende Worte - James Bond musik

- Vorstellung: Mein Name ist Berner, Dominik Berner ;)

# * Thema: Wie sollen agile/moderne Unternhemen und Teams aufgebaut sein und agieren um erfolgreich zu sein. Eine Analaogie mit James Bond in der Hauptrolle. 
Der Wert von vielen Firmen sind heutzutage die Mitarbeiter 

# Behauptung: 

* - Erfolgreiche Unternehmen sind etwas wie das MI-6 aus den James Bond Filmen. 
	1. Sie haben James Bond und 
	2. kreieren sie ein Umfeld in dem James Bond performt 
	(3. Sie haben James-Bond-Bösewichte als Konkurrenten) - Fokus auf Umfeld in den JB performt

Alternativen
- Wenn James Bond nicht bei euch arbeitet seid ihr nicht modern unterwegs
- Firmen ohne das James-Bond-Paket gehen unter
- James bond ist nur so gut wie die Struktur die um ihn herum besteht. 
- Ein Unternehmen in dem James Bond arbeiten würde ist unbesiegbar
- James Bond hat wegen seiner "unternehmensstruktur" gewonnen nicht nur wegen seinen Skills
	- Ihr könnt die Skills der Leute nur begrenzt beinflussen - Wir haben expertenmangel - Ausbildung hilft aber


# Selbstpräsentation:
 C++ Coder, Agilist und Geheimagent

# Überblick:

# Nutzen für Publikum: Denkanstoss wie man Mitarbeiter in einem modernen Unternehmen behandelt. 
 - Wenn ihr nicht wisst wo anpacken, fragt euch was würde James Bond tun?

# Argumente:  
 
James bond is:
- Self organizing  & Empowered (Gets a goal/vision does it, how is secondary) 
	- He gets scolded about his methods and has boundaries (very few)
	- His Enemies appear to be centralized and have disloyal employees
	- Das ist wichtig, weil wenn JB immer nach hause telefonieren müsste, bevor er etwas tut ist er immer ein schritt hintendran.
	- Die Organisation/MI-6/M nimmt sich zeit für ein ausgedehntes Briefing: Das sind Alignment sessions. 
		- Primäre Ziele und Sekundäre (1. Bösewicht muss gestoppt werden, 2. Diamantent retour, Ob Bösewicht gefangen gekillt sekundär, Sachschaden sekundär) 
- He got the tools provided - Q the ultimate devops
	- MI-6 investiert in akutelle (oder sogar bleeding edge) technologien
	- Da wird viel experimentiert und verworfen, damit ein paar killer-features übrig bleiben
	- Q-S tools sind eure infrastruktur
		- Side Note: James Bond gets training in these things
- He got the skill
	- Social skills - and awareness of the surrounding world and politics
	- He has a high degree of training - continously 60ies James bond would be fucked with modern tech 
	- JB is crossfunctional he can do whatever needed to deliver: Be it fly a plane, drive a tank, shoot, explosives, bungee jumping, mountaineering...


- James Bond is not alone 
	- Gets the army/navy to pull him our of the shit?
	- Has skilled and powerful friends (Felix) which help him

- Loyal and aligned with superiors
- James bond has unlimited resources which he can pull on - No questions asked

- He delivers what is needed, not what is wanted (diamonds are forever - the diamonds stay in the sky, but the world exists on)
- He brings the enemy to his side

Villians:
- Lack skills
- Tightly controlled by superiors
- Few rock stars (Biter, Natalja, Frisbee, big bad germans)
- No trust in employers - They turn sides often
- Rely on monolithic bases, one point of failure 
- Blofeld returns frequently

JB gets critisied for his methods, but he delivers
	- Q you and your methods are relicts of the cold war

Bad things about JB: 
 - Not that much a team player? 	

# Zusammenfassung 
 
Realistically: 

Be the place that hires james bond - Or a team that is james bond because JB is fiction. 
SKills etc can be trained but the mindset has to be there and created around
