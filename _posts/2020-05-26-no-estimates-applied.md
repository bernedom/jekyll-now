title: How we developed software using #NoEstimates

**"NoEstimates sounds nice, but it's unrealistic in the real world."** This is a sentence I heard a few times. So how does one run a team using #NoEstimates? A recent software project I was working on for a customer did exactly that. We built a product without estimating a single user story. No story points, no sprint commitments but lots of slicing, prioritization and a fast, adaptive roadmap for the desired featureset. 

Of course not everything went smoothly, there were some of the usual speed-bumps like UI designs that matched corporate CI that came very late, infrastructure libraries that underwent a complete rewrite and subsequent interface change and features that did not survive the first user study and had to be taken out again. But overall the project went well, was fun and most of all the development process was lean and agile. 

## No Estimates but lots of forecast

Noestimates does not mean complete absence of planning for the future. We forecasted potential development often and even had some milestone dates on which certain features had to be available. But we did that without talking about the cost of a single story or haggling about t-shirt sizes for a certain feature or acceptance criteria. 
Instead we invested in relentless slicing of stories and prioritization by value. We measured cycle time of the stories and used the mean average as base for a forecast. We tracked progress by using a cumulative flow diagram and built a planning strategy around how our optimal graph would look like. 

Were we faster? No, but in the end by not giving an estimate we were much more predictable and more focussed on delivering value than delivering what is cheap.

* Build Story map
* Big chunks of functionality, sliced by use case
* slice down to stories if in doubt create two **link to slicing article**
* Mark story as ready
* Do it
* resolve it
* review it 
* close it
