**"NoEstimates sounds nice, but it is hard to pull off."** I heard this sentence or a variation of it a lot. But actually running a NoEstimates development is not hard at all. NoEstimates means not estimating any story, but it does not mean the absence of any forecasting. By tracking the throughput of a team and a slim development process NoEstimates becomes a big enabler as it shifts the talk from spent effort to value delivered and the content of a product. But how does this look in practice? 



# 

* Define storysize = cycle time
* value stream mapping New -> Ready -> Doing -> Done 
* Tracking, cumulative flow diagram
* Weekdays / story 

** diagram average story size / cycle time **

# The Beginning

If your team is new on or new on a product you're lacking any of the data. So the only remedy for that is to get going or wild guessing. Create a high-level storymap of what you consider a MVP, with the stress on **Minimal** and start working.
