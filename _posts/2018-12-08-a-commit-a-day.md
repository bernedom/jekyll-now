**Most hobby projects die at the idea stage.** 
A while ago I decided to revive an old idea of mine to implement the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) as a [strongly typed C++ library](https://github.com/bernedom/SI). In order to try to bring this project forward I tried an experiment: **I would make at least one commit each workday for a month**. So a month later I am somewhat proud to say, that I kept this promise to myself, with only one "comittless" day. But how does my pet project look now?

# I'm I done yet?

On average I spent only around 30 minutes on my project, most days during lunch break, sometimes when commuting to or from work. So not surprising, when looking purely at the code my library made some progress, but is still very far from being useable in production. In fact a lot of the intendend functionality is still missing. On the other hand I learned a lot of things and experimented with some concepts of modern C++ in ther process. I'm particularly proud that I have a working CI system and that I was able to pull off a TDD aproach when developing. 

But more interesting is that spending a small amount of time each day on my project put me into a state of **creative flow**. When I started my "month of commitment" the project was in the state of a pure experiment, a few badly formatted hacked together files that already proved the concept of what I wanted to do, but where nowehre the kind of code that I wanted the world to see. Nevertheless I created a repo on github and started to get to work.
