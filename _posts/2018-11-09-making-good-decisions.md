**How good are your decisions?** - Every day we decide a lot of things small and big. At work or any professional setting we often have clear deciders. This can be a senior subject matter expert, the traditional "boss" or some collaborative process in an emporwered team - it does not really matter. Contrary to our private live in business we often have to make decisions more explicit and documented, for instance in the form of meeting minutes. Some people are good at deciding, others find it very hard.

## Good decisions are valuable descisions
 
There are certain qualities which make decisions "good" in the sense that taking it added some value to an existing situation. This value is often not primarily defined by the outcome of the decision taken, but how important it was to take that decision at that moment. In genereal I see **any decision which fails to trigger a distinct action in those involved is a worthless decision. Valuable decisions are explicit and well understood by the peolple involved and even if not everybody agrees there is at least consent to act on that decision for the time being.** Bad decisions are fuzzy, heavily disputed and implemented grudgingly if at all by the people affected. There are even invisible decisions - those where people affected by it are not even aware that it has been taken. The consecquences again are again failure to implement the decision or even worse acting involuntarily against it.

## How people decide

People fall generally into two categories when it comes to decision-making-habits. There are the ones who decide early and watch the outcome and then adjust frequently and others who try to first find and analyze as many options as possible before deciding and decide as late as possible. People in the first category often feel uncomfortable and left hanging until a decision is taken, while people in the second category often experience doubt after taking a decision, often this doubt is about if the decision was taken prematurely. Both ways have their merits and drawbacks. The quick deciders often have to readjust or even revert decisions because they lacked part of the context surrounding the matter to be decided on. The careful analysts sometimes miss the opportunity for a decision and might be seen as not deciding at all. Both ways work well on their own. The problems happen when people from the different spectrum have to work together and are unaware of where of the spectrum each of them is. This is of course not a black-and-white matter but depending on a lot of factors and people might behave differently in different contexts and different social settings.

To be good at making decisions being aware what kind of decision-making-process is happening is very helpful. Self reflection about and what kind of decider you are is also a very good starting point. I often take a moment and think about how dicussions that lead to decisions look like for me or my teams. How we arrived at certain decisisions is freqeuent topic in many of my teams retrospectives.  Making this process of thinking transparent to others is an essential part on how well decisions are accepted. Stating your tendency on how you make decisions explicitely often helps as well. 

Apart from how you like your decisions it is also important to be clear on how you arrive to that decision. Some people like to put all possible options and thoughts into words and ask for advice before, some people like to refine these options first in private and then discuss only the synthesis of that. Big misunderstandings often happen when one approach is confused with the other. If people are expecting only a synthesis of the context and a decision, but find themselves in a discussion about options it is very likely that each of these options might be mistaken for a "final" decision and thus the decider might seem to jump from one decision onto another. If on the other hand people are prepared to discuss options but receive only an already made decision they proably complain about lack of consideration of different options. 

## Communicate your decision strategy 

No matter what your style of making decision is, it helps tremendously to make your preferred strategy on how to arrive at a decision clear and transparent. Also make it clear if you are adapting or abandoning that strategy in favor of another. My personal bias is towards fast decisions that get readjusted frequently, and I often convey this to people by telling them about the more experimental nature of the decision I'm going to take, sometimes even putting a timeframe on my decision when it should be checked against facts or be refined further. Saying things like "I'm going to collect feedback, synthesise and then decide" or "let's discuss options first without deciding and then agree on a synthesis on which I will base my decision" helps you to outline intended decision-strategy to people. This serves to align people to your thought-process but it also gives them the chance to challenge any part of it. 

## Reflect on how you arrived at a decision

Whenever desisions are under contest a first reflex is often to put just the content of the decision under scrutiny but it is often equally important to refelct on how one arrived at a decision. Doing so often helps spotting where things went not as expected - or where expectations differ - much better and thus is of much more value to any actions to improve the situation. This is especially true if past decisions, or the perceived lack of them, leads to fights and discussions regularly. 

Reflecting about your personal decision habits is a good way to find gaps of how different people perceive the decision. This of course is a good thing to do at all time, not just when things go wrong. Ask yourself: 

1. Was a decision taken at all? 
1. Was it clear that a decision was taken (and who took it)? 
1. Did it trigger a distinct and timely action in those affected?

Only if these three questions can be answered with "yes" by all people involved this was a "good" decision. If any of the questions where answered with "no", tackle to turn that into a yes in the future first. The first two points can be made clearer by being aware and transparent of the though process behind decisions as described above. The third is often more related to the content of the decision. 

So next time a tough decision is on the agenda - take a step back and answer these questions. Happy deciding!
