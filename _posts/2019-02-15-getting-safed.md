**SAFe is the worst implementation of "corporate agile" that is out there!** Over the last few months I heard this sentence or a variety of it quite a few time. I also said it a few times as well. The [SAFe-framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com) is far from what I call "agile", but it has a few good things as well. So it is worth to have a more differentiated look at it. 

# Getting SAFed 

Over the lasts few months I had the opportunity to be on the receiving end of a professionally conducted transition of a departement in a large, multinational company to SAFe. This implementation of the scaled agile framework was led by a very experienced coach from a distinguished consulting company, so I had the luck of seing experts at work here. I was - and remain - quite skeptical about the SAFe-framework, but I decided to [take me by own words]({{site.base_url}}/agile-beyond-team-size/) to help to make it a success and in the meantime getting a good look at how this is working out. What I got is a hands-on opportunity to see how the SAFe the mechanics work, which of them are really powerful tools and which are actually counter-productive when striving for a lean, agile mindset. 

# One dictionary to bind them all

The biggest advantage of SAFe I see is that it is very, very well documented. Just have a look at [the landing page of SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com), everything is clickable and there are tons of well written articles, guides, checklists and templates to be used. Together with a very structured way on how to onoboard everybody onto SAFe this is a very handy thing, because this is providing a **common vocabulary across the organisation** when it comes to the operating model to be used. Everybody knows the different between "Iteration" and "Increment", or at least knows where to look it up.

# Big room plannings - Good idea

One of the more prominent things of SAFe are the big room plannings that are to be executed roughly four time a year. In a nutshell all the people working on the same product meet in a big room for two days and hammer out a plan for the next few months. This is a very powerful method to align people to a common cause and to foster transparency about the "what" that will be done in the next few months. Chuck in some parts about managing inter-team dependencies and state and confirm assumptions on the spot and the content that is generated is of a very high quality. So far so good? Yes and no. After having experienced it I'm very much a fan of the method and setup itself, however the way that it is executed in safe goes into way too much detail, requiring the teams to plan in stories into up to five sprints in adavnce and then commit to delivering them. Instead of stopping at the point where teams are aware of their goals and dependencies and then setting them to work in an autonomous manner, going into that kind of detail is severely restricting the freedom to operate of the teams. After all you **committed** to a plan for 5 sprints, so as a consequence deviating from that plan needs quite a bit of justification, which has the potential to encourage teams to rather stick to the plan instead of adapting it to the current situation.
