**SAFe is the worst implementation of "corporate agile" that is out there!** Over the last few months I heard this sentence or a variety of it quite a few time. I also said it a few times as well. The [SAFe-framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com) is far from what I call "agile", but it has a few good things as well. And despite all the critics it is a very popular framework that is implemented in a lot of bigger companies. So it is worth to have a more differentiated look at it. 

# Getting SAFed 

Over the lasts few months I had the opportunity to be on the receiving end of a professionally conducted transition of a departement in a large, multinational company to SAFe. This implementation of the scaled agile framework was led by an experienced coach from a distinguished consulting company, so I had the luck of seeing experts at work here. I was - and remain - quite skeptical about the SAFe-framework, but I decided to [take me by own words]({{site.base_url}}/agile-beyond-team-size/) to help to make transformation a success and in the meantime getting a good look at how this is working out. What I got is a hands-on opportunity to see how the SAFe the mechanics work, which of them are really powerful tools (a few) and which are actually counter-productive when striving for a lean, agile mindset. All in all I still remain on my opinion that SAFe is a far from optimal framework to get the most out of "the agile way" but it is a possible first step for rigid companies to become more agile in operation and in mindset. 

# One dictionary to bind them all

The biggest advantage of SAFe I see is that it is very, very well documented. Just have a look at [the landing page of SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com), everything is clickable and there are tons of well written articles, guides, checklists and templates to be used. It even includes a structured way on how to onoboard everybody in a company to SAFe and a step by step guide to introduce it. Having this amount of coherent documentation this is a very handy thing, because this is providing a **common vocabulary across the organisation** when it comes to the operating model to be used. Everybody knows the different between "Iteration" and "Increment", or at least knows where to look it up.

# Built for speed in implementing

A thing that is very nice about SAFe is that it is built for speed in implementing, it took only a bit more thant three months from the first trainings until the structural transformation to SAFe model to happen which was very fast, considered that company spend almost two years reorganizing itself just a few years ago. Having such a no-nonsense attitude in getting things done is very much admiarble. The downside is that people get two days of training

# Big room plannings - A Good idea taken too far

One of the more prominent things of SAFe are the big room plannings that are to be executed roughly four time a year. In a nutshell all the people working on the same product meet in a big room for two days and hammer out a plan for the next few months. This is a very powerful method to align people to a common cause and to foster transparency about the "what" that will be done in the next few months. Chuck in some parts about managing inter-team dependencies and state and confirm assumptions on the spot and the content that is generated is of a very high quality. So far so good? Yes and no. After having experienced it I'm very much a fan of the method and setup itself, however the way that it is executed in safe goes into way too much detail, requiring the teams to plan in stories into up to five sprints in adavnce and then commit to delivering them. Instead of stopping at the point where teams are aware of their goals and dependencies and then setting them to work in an autonomous manner, going into that kind of detail is severely restricting the freedom to operate of the teams. After all you **committed** to a plan for 5 sprints, so as a consequence deviating from that plan needs quite a bit of justification, which has the potential to encourage teams to rather stick to the plan instead of adapting it to the current situation. 

# Putting a break on self-organizing

SAFe propagates a layered organizationan structure with a clear flow of information, which is very nice as it scales very easily. Depending on the size of the organisation you get fewer or more layers added. The downside of this is that these are not structures that eoncourage self-organisazion and empowerement. There is always one guy above with whom to coordinate and there is often a layer below which should execute something. Together with a propagated unification of technology and tools across the whole organisation[^1] this limits the amount of freedom the people executing the product have. In such an environment empowering themselves and getting the needed freedom of movement - agility in other words - to the ground is very hard. As the framework requires you to sync upwards speed of change is very much dictated by the people living a layer above you. Of course the SAFe guide proposes that this is not how it should work and with the right people it actually could work out. MY main critique to this is that is that it blatantly ignores where people are coming from and that in most cases you probably not building SAFe up from scratch but on existing - and possibly dysfunctional - company structures. So having one set of rigid structures replaced with another is very unlikely to end up with people changing their attitute significantly.
