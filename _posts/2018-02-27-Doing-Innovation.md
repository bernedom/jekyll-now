LINKS TO DESIGN STUDIO - find book

**We need to be innovative!** - I heard this statement or a variation of it many, many times over my past in working as a software engineer. We engineers love this, as we get more time to tinker with anything we find interesting - Which is a lot. The result are often better tools or tool-chains to make our life as developers easier, but very rarely the output changes something for the users of the product we were working on. The thing is that on these innovation days we are usually stuck together with other engineers which means that we mainly see and discuss engineering problems. 

It is also interesting that companies doing this often like to present themselves as "We are an innovative company, we use very modern software". While this is indeed nice and appeals to me as a software developer, I don't think that using bleeding edge technology makes you an innovative company. In my experience it is very rare that an elegant engineering solution led to a new feature on a product just by itself. While this often works as a spark for start-up companies, more mature companies seem to have difficulties in harnessing these possibilities. As a result most of the time the output of such engineering-driven "innovation" was the same product, just better engineered. A good thing by itself, but not what I necessarily call innovative. 

It is possible to add what I like to call "business innovation" to the "technical innovation" and the solution in this lies in the crossfunctionality of the teams. **First of all, include the product owner, business annalists and other business oriented people in the innovation process.** Change the question for innovating to "What could be the next sellable product?" or similar. **Then** have the engineers figure out the feasibility by doing early mocks and spikes. It is also possible to apply almost the same techniques from software development to this innovation. Methods such as pair- or mob-developing an idea work very well in my experience. Taking an afternoon of time to create a show-and-tell for new products often produces a lot of valuable ideas in a short time. On a more formal side there are methods such as "design studio" that help to find new ideas in a structured manner. 

But just finding the ideas is not enough the teams finding them have to be given the power to make them happen as well. Again this is something I have seen failing a few times, because again the ideas then were handed over to either just the engineers or just the "business people", neither fully empowered - and willing - to make a product go in all it's aspect. In contrast at that point, people often need some kind of coaxing to keep at an ongoing idea alive and pursue it and not just drop it in favor of the next shiny thing they might think of. But having all the necessary people on board makes it much more likely that someone will champion an idea and help the team following it through until it becomes a real product to develop.
