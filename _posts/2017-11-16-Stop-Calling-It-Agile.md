title: We should stop calling it agile 
---

**We should stop calling it *agile* and start calling it *modern company culture*.** In the past fifteen years the word 'agile' has become widely popular in software development and other technology affine areas of business, but still people find it hard to find a consensus on what 'agile' means for them or their company. There seems to be an agreement that agile development contains such processes as scrum, kanban, xp or on a bigger scale SAFE, Less and all the other frameworks out there. But also an often heard complain by people involved in software development is that they are never "100% agile", or that they do scrum but find it hard to get that omnious culture shift happening in their companies. 
And then are these agile conferences where the talk is no longer about how to apply scrum etc. but about holocracy, servant leadership, change management, T-shaped employees and so on. 'Agile' has grown out of software development - a good thing in my opinion - but we fail to adapt the wording to a larger scale, which makes it hard to explain certain concepts in a way which produces alignment in people outside software development. As a consequence 'agile' is still heavily connotated as a pure "development-methodoolgy" in a lot of business circles. 

But we're no longer talking about changing single teams of software developers but about building agile companies. We're advocating flat hierarchies, management by peer, role- and context-based responsibilities, planning on the fly in a vertical manner and much more. We want the co-located, cross-functional team but fail to take HR with us and thus try to build teams on inflexible and too slow processes in people development. So we get them on board and call it agile HR, I still find it hard to pronounce that out lout. Then there is the gap to sales selling fixed scope, fixed time projects to customers expecting exactly these kind of projects. So we apply a fast act-sense-respond principle to sales and marketing and integrate them closer into our development teams. And everything is somehow controlled and tied in to finance and budgeting, arguably one of the facets of a company that is perceived as distinctively un-agile. No problem, we agilize the middle management, throw away all those layers of reporting and create a lean-startup structure in the company. And suddenly we're talking about completely reorganizing and restructuring companies, something traditionally done by C-Level executives.

And yet we task as "scrum master" with it, a title very unfitting for work on that level. Let's call this position **agile coach**. There much better. But is it good enough? Should we go even further an call them "Change Champions", "Chief Change Officers" or "Company Transformation Experts" to take away the smell of software development from the position. And while we're on it, lets call it "modern company culture" and make "agile" a subset of that. 

Does renaming really help? Yes and no. One reason why scrum and kanban and their larger cousin SAFE are so successful and widely used is because they come with a clear label, which makes it easier to sell to the willing.
