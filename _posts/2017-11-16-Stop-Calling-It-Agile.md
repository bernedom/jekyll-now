title: We should stop calling it agile 
---

We should stop calling it agile and start calling it modern company culture. In the past fifteen years the word 'agile' has become widely popular in software development but still people find it hard to find a consensus on what 'agile' means for them or their company. There seems to be an agreement that agile development contains such processes as scrum, kanban, xp or on a bigger scale SAFE, Less and all the other frameworks out there. But also an often heard complain by people involved in software development is that they are never 100% agile, or that they do scrum but find it hard to get that omnious culture shift through in their companies. 
And then are these agile conferences where the talk is no longer about how to apply scrum etc. but about holocracy, servant leadership, change management, T-shaped employees and so on. 'Agile' has grown out of software development - a good thing in my opinion - but we fail to adapt the wording to a larger scale, which makes it hard to explain certain concepts in a way which produces alignment in people outside software development. 

We're also no longer talking about changing single teams of sofware developers but about building agile companies. We're advocating flat hierarchies, management by peer, role- and context-based responsibilities, planning on the fly and much more. We want the co-located, cross-functional team but fail to take HR with us and thus try to build teams on inflexible and too slow processes in people development. Of course HR is often bound by budget questions, notably one of the facettes of a company which is perceived as very unagile. Then there is the gap to sales selling fixed scope, fixed time projects to customers expecting exaclty these projects.
