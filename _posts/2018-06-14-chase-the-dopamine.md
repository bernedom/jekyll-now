Motivation is an elusive thing. Sometimes one is bursting with it, sometimes it is hard to find. Luckily kick-starting motivation is easier than one might think. 
Everyone probably knows the feeling that work (and live in general) is an endless drudgery of monotonous days after days? Even worse these days are full of stress and there is a constant pressure to deliver something but it's hard to find the motivation for it because everything looks so boring? Then you might ask yourself "how can that be that I'm working with so many capable, highly competent people but it still is demotivating and nothing seems to happen around here"? If this is the case you are lacking a healthy dose of dopamine. 

Dopamine, together with Endorphin, Serotonin and Oxytocin, is one of the four a self-produced hormones that make up that warm, fuzzy feeling that everything goes smooth and well. Hormones are our bodies control mechanism to create incentives and rewards for us to jump into action and thus are - one a pure biological/chemical level - responsible to motivate us. Overall those hormones should be more or less balanced out to function properly. Too much of one and we get the incentive to bahave in a certain direction - which is exactly what evolution designed those things for. Very much simplified one can separate those four hormones into their main tasks:

* **Dopamine** creates the good feeling you get if you succeed at something.
* **Endorphin** is a painkiller, it makes you go one when things are tough.
* **Serotonin** makes you feel appreciated so it makes you want to share your deeds.
* **Oxytocin** helps with creating a feeling of social security by creating intimacy and closeness.

Raising one of the hormones above the natural threshold makes the body raise the others as well to recreate the balance between the four and then get back to a "normal" level. On an evolutionary level having low levels on those four hormones is a sign that things go well. No need to go hunting or to change anything on the social structure of your tribe. You can slack off and lie in the shade all day. In the modern oftentimes changing social structure of a working place bears some organisational constraints. Throw in lack of appreciation and estrangement from your team-mates and you got a good recipe for demotivation. However more often than not we are expected to deliver something instead of lying in the shade all day. To get out of this valley of misery we just need to raise the level of one of the hormones. And Dopamine is the simplest one to raise. 

Raising the dopamine level is surprisingly easy. Just get something simple done. This can be a very minor thing like cleaning your desk including cleaning all those drawers from that accumulated junk. Or finally unsubscribing from all those junk mails from those shops that we once bought something at and now get weekly advertisements. It does not really matter what you do, but it is important that it has a visible end result to you and that it takes at least ten minutes of focus solely on that task. The task do not have to be *that* small, but they should be small enough that they can be completed in one go. 
Once you're finished get up, look at the result and say to yourself. "I'm done!". Do you feel that tiny bit of satisfaction that things are now better than before? That's the dopamine! Enjoy that feeling and start with the next (bigger) task. Generally I try to find problems that are small but annoying to solve if I need an urgent dopamine fix. 
Over the time I got real good at setting myself achievable goals for my dopamine hunts. It is true that the larger and harder the task is, the bigger the dopamine rush at the end; A proper all-out dopamine high can feel like you're on top of the world and that everything is possible, which is a truly great feeling. However the the caveat is that we get the dopamine only if we finish the thing we took on, no dopamine for quitters. 

Dopamine is good for finding short-time motivation, but it does not last long. To get a lasting effect we have to get the other chemicals going as well. Since Serotonin and Oxytocin are dependant on other people's reaction it is important that we make the effort and solution of our dopamine-inducing tasks visible. Especially with work on a computer this requires a bit of effort, as the small tasks we do are often not observable from the outside. The solution is simple, tell people about your success and why your life is better now. A simple "Ah, my mailbox looks so empty, now that I unsubscribed from all that junk" over a cup of coffee.

**"It is really demotivating, nothing gets done here."** This is a complaint I hear frequently. This surprisingly often comes from people I see working hard and that I esteem as quite capable of actually doing and completing things.
