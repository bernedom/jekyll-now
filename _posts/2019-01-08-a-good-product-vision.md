**A good product vision is the cornerstone of being successful in delivering software products.** Acutally this is true for any product, especially if this is to be done in an agile manner. Having a product vision that is tangible and accepted by your developers is the a&o, if teams are supposed to work in an empowered and self-organized way. The vision is paramount in creating a *purpose* for everyone working towards it, which is the founndation in creating alignment between individuals, teams and organisazions. Unfortunately lots of companies seem to struggle with creating a vision that is good enough to facilitate that. 

# The purpose of a vision

The purpose of a vision is to be a beacon towards which each action we do is aimed at. Or in other words each feature delivered should bring us a step closer to the vision.

# A good vision

A good vision should be vivid enough so it can become a tangible thing. The word vision itself comes from the latin "visere" which means "seeing" and that is already a very good description of what makes a good vision. People should be able to "see" it - at least in a metaphysical way. "We want to build the best tractor for the the agricultural market. " this is not a vision, this is a marketing slogan. And a bad one at that. A good vision is descriptive on how it is working. "We want to build a tractor that does is fully automated and connected to the cloud. " much better but not yet good enough.

[John Deere has an excellent video about their product vision ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t08nOEkrX-I)
It is not tangible. What does 'best' mean? Best at what? Best as in cheapest? 
Is already better. "
