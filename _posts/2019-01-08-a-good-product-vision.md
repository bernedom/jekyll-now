**A good product vision is the cornerstone of being successful in delivering software products.** Actually this is true for any product in development, not just software. Having a product vision that is tangible and accepted by your developers is the a&o, if teams are supposed to work in an empowered and self-organized way. The vision is paramount in creating a *purpose* for everyone working towards it, which is the foundation in creating alignment between individuals, teams and organisazions. Unfortunately lots of companies seem to struggle with creating a vision that is good enough to facilitate that. 

# The purpose of a vision

The purpose of a vision is to be a beacon towards which each action we do is aimed at. Or in other words each feature delivered should bring us a step closer to the vision. An essential factor for doing successful agile development is to build a common alignment, else people will have a very hard time to intrisically motivate themselves to a common goal. A good vision is a very powerful tool for creating such an alignment within the people building the product. This common purpose is not just important for motivation but a basis for unlocking many other benefits of agile development such autonomous and fast decision making and much more. 

# A good vision - John Deere

A good vision should be vivid enough so it can become a tangible thing. The word "vision" itself comes from the latin "visere" which means "seeing" and that is already a very good description of what makes a good vision. People should be able to "see" it - at least in a metaphysical way. "We want to build the best tractor for the the agricultural market. " this is not a vision, this is a marketing slogan. And a bad one at that. A good vision is descriptive on how it is working. "We want to build a tractor that does is fully automated and connected to the cloud." much better but not yet good enough. 
"We want the farmer to get up in the morning, check the weather, irrigation status and other things relevant to farming on their smart phone and from there direct their tractors to do the work best suited for todays needs." - Now we're getting closer to a good vision. Check out [John Deere's excellent video about their product vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t08nOEkrX-I) to get the full picture. 

What John Deere did with their vision, was to take it away from the product and focus it on their users. By doing so they changed the topic from what they wanted to build (a fully automated tractor connected to the cloud) to what problem they wanted to solve: "Taking the backbreaking part out of farmers work and helping them process the information in their very complex environment better to make better decisions yielding in better farming output."

The vision also shifts of what John Deeres product is. It is no longer only the tractor but an end-to-end solution from processing information up to the hand on tractor and various appliances. **A good vision is shaping and defining the product, not the other way around.** It does it by highlighting what is not obvious when we thing of "John Deere". Thinking of "John Deere" as tractors is obvious. Thinking of "John Deere" as a data provider is not.

Putting it into a well produced video helps a lot with visualizing but it does not necessarily be done, but having drawings of your vision helps a lot. Because if you struggle to put something into a drawing it probably is not yet tangible enough.

No vision was correct in the first go. Finding a vision is tough work and needs some serious thinking on it. The people at John Deere probably spent quite some time on their vision and had to refine it multiple times to arrive at such a consistent narrative. 
While product visions should have certain stability at their core, they will get refined and sonme details will shift over time, reflecting changed circumstances and hopefully the growth of the product. 

# Commit to the vision - make it public

A very important point in establishing a vision is to commit to it and have a definitive statement like "this is where we want to go". One of the easiest ways to signal that commitment is to make the vision publicly visible. This does not necessarily mean to put it on youtube and advertise it, but making sure that there is a consistent communication about what the vision is. For products not available for the general public publishing and commiting to a vision might take an entirely other form. Even if the vision is not made fully public, being prepared to do so is a good sign that a vision is mature and commitable enough. 

No matter how the communication works bein committed and getting the buy in from the people building this vision is essential. The buy in also serves as a good measurement about the quality of the vision. If you find it hard to get the people building a product to commit to a vision, it might need some rework. Since every feature developed should be tied to the vision, if this is hard that is another hint that the vision or the product definition need some more work. 

# Having a 20/20 vision

Building a vision is not easy, but having a good one makes up easily for all the effort put into it. Take a step back and look at your product vision - should you already have one - and check: 

 * Is it tangible? Does reading/seeing it create a mental image? 
 * Does it highlight the non-obvious? 
 * Is it about the problem and the user of the product? 
 * Can it evolve without falling apart?
 * Are you commited to work towards it? Can you work towards it on a day-to-day basis?

If you can answer the questions wit a definitive "yes" good! See wher it leads to. If not, get your vision through another iteration add what's missing and take away what's obvious or superflous.
