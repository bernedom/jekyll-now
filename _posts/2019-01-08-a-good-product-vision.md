**A good product vision is the cornerstone of being successful in delivering software products.** Actually this is true for any product in development, not just software. Having a product vision that is tangible and accepted by your developers is the a&o, if teams are supposed to work in an empowered and self-organized way. The vision is paramount in creating a *purpose* for everyone working towards it, which is the founndation in creating alignment between individuals, teams and organisazions. Unfortunately lots of companies seem to struggle with creating a vision that is good enough to facilitate that. 

# The purpose of a vision

The purpose of a vision is to be a beacon towards which each action we do is aimed at. Or in other words each feature delivered should bring us a step closer to the vision.

# A good vision - John Deere

A good vision should be vivid enough so it can become a tangible thing. The word "vision" itself comes from the latin "visere" which means "seeing" and that is already a very good description of what makes a good vision. People should be able to "see" it - at least in a metaphysical way. "We want to build the best tractor for the the agricultural market. " this is not a vision, this is a marketing slogan. And a bad one at that. A good vision is descriptive on how it is working. "We want to build a tractor that does is fully automated and connected to the cloud." much better but not yet good enough. 
"We want the farmer to get up in the morning, check the weather, irrigation status and other things relevant to farming on their smart phone and from there direct their tractors to do the work best suited for todays needs." - Now we're getting closer to a good vision. Check out [John Deere's excellent video about their product vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t08nOEkrX-I) to get the full picture. 

What John Deere did with their vision, was to take it away from the product and focus it on their users. By doing so they changed the topic from what they wanted to build (a fully automated tractor connected to the cloud) to what problem they wanted to solve: "Taking the backbreaking part out of farmers work and helping them process the information in their very complex environment better to make better decisions yielding in better farming output."

The vision also shifts of what John Deeres product is. It is no longer only the tractor but an end-to-end solution from processing information up to the hand on tractor and various appliances. **A good vision is shaping and defining the product, not the other way around.** It does it by highlighting what is not obvious when we thing of "John Deere". Thinking of "John Deere" as tractors is obvious. Thinking of "John Deere" as a data provider is not.

Putting it into a well produced video helps a lot with visualizing but it does not necessarily be done, but having drawings of your vision helps a lot. Because if you struggle to put something into a drawing it probably is not yet tangible enough.

# Visions change

No vision was correct in the first go. Finding a vision is tough work and needs some serious thinking on it. John Deere probably spent quite some time on that video and had to refine it multiple times to arrive at such a consistent narrative. 

# Commit to the vision - make it public

Vision kommt von sehen
Beschreinend, bild, video
Vision ist was nicht selbstverständlich ist
Jedes feature muss zur vision führen oder die vision verändern
Visionen wachsen, evolutionärer prozess
Visions are about the customer/Stakeholders/those affected by the product - the problem
