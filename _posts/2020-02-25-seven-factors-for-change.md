**Change is everywhere in modern organizations. Those organizations that find it easy to change succeed, the others suffer.**
Life in modern companies is signified by fast and frequent changes. Be it agile transformations, digitalization, new tools, new technology, new methods, new processes (and much more) - there are are many powerful drivers for change in a modern [VUCA-World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility%2C_uncertainty%2C_complexity_and_ambiguity)
While the stories of painful and failed transformations and changes are abundant, there are organizations who successfully change seemingly without all the pain usually associated with it. What makes their changes much more likely to succeed? And how make they change appear easy? 
Together with a few colleagues at [bbv Software Services](https://www.bbv.ch) I took a dive into the topic and we came up with **seven major factors that contribute to successful and lightweight change**. 

## What makes a change successful?

Before digging into how changes are successfully executed, one has to look at what makes a change successful. Regardless of whether an organization moves to grow better or if its moving to fix a wrong situation, successfully executed changes share the same characteristics.

Successful changes are: 

* **target-oriented**: an explicit and measurable target state exists and is clearly communicated
* **act where they should and how they should**: Consequently the side-effects are minimal
* **sustainable**: The effects are long-lasting and here to stay without burning out the people involved
* **accepted in their urgency**: The affected people understand that this change has to happen now
* **accepted in how they are brought about**: People understand the process on how this change is being enacted
* **experienced positively**: People see the change not as a "necessary evil" but as an opportunity for a better future
* **actively supported by the affected people**: People change willingly and actively contribute to bring the change about

## The seven factors for success

In order to bring about successful change we identified seven interlinked factors that affect the success criteria. They are:

***TODO: Add image (clickable???)***

* **Need for change**: A concise problem statement and explicit gap to "good" 
* **Leadership and vision**: Approachable people who expertly formulate and transport a vision of the target state
* **Support and reflection**: Methodical support in facilitation and unbiased reflection for the leaders and people involved
* **Ability and will to change**: The necessary skill and will to learn to enact the change in all people affected
* **Approach suited to complex problems**: A small, iterative cycle to quickly verify and adapt any hypotheses
* **Resistance**: Treating resistance as an opportunity for communication and refinement 
* **Organizational cultures**: Keen awareness about the visible and invisible parts of company cultures

### Need for change

Formulating the *need for change* as a concise problem statement is the central anchoring point for any change.
Explicitly showing the gap of "as is" to "as should" is necessary, to transport an accepted justification about the coming change to the people affected. The "Why are we changing?" is much more important than the "what" or "how are we changing?". 
While describing the non-optimal effects felt by the current situation is a good start focusing on the root causes of current situation problem is what prevents the effects of the change to be only temporary or being reversed in a short time.   

### Leadership and vision

The leaders of any change hold a [tangible vision]({{site.base_url}}/a-good-product-vision) that closely relates to the *need for change*. 
By plausibly illustrating how a desired target state will look and feel like the leadership creates a focal point for those involved or affected by the change. Once this focal point is established regular and good-willed guidance towards it is what successful leadership is about. 
People are led by other people, not by anonymous roles or catch-all groups, so not being able to name the actual people is a big sign of weak leadership. As a core skill, strong communication is a must for any people in the leadership clique.   


### Support and reflection

The *need for change* and an appropriate and competent *leadership* are the content authority for any change. In order to support facilitating of the change, a coach that is not directly affected by the change is a must. This allows the leadership to focus on the vision and provides an unbiased point for reflection. This can be external coaches but this does not have to be always the case. It is however important that whoever fills the role of the change coach is visible and accessible to the people affected by the change. 

### Ability to change

If the *need for change* is one side o the coin, the *ability and will to change* is the other. Before a change can be enacted it might be necessary to build up any skills needed for it first. This might take the form of special training for a tool or method. Closely related to the ability to change is having the will to change. By building the necessary skills along with a broadly accepted and understood *vision* people are motivated that changes are opportunities for a better future. 

### Approach suited to complex problems 

Organizational changes are complex problems - cause and effect might be observable in a retrospective, but are not predictable. As such an iterative, exploratory approach of hypothesis - verification - adaptation is a must. 
Many fast cycles of leaving the status quo, enacting the change and finding stability again are the way to react to changes in the environment and celebrate achievements often.   

### Resistance to change

As opposition to the *ability to change* there is *resistance to change*. Encountering active resistance means that the change is felt, which is a good thing. The lack of any resistance during a change might be a hint that the change is either not having an effect, is stalled or is affecting at the wrong place. 
Resistance has always to be taken seriously and should be a welcome challenge to check if the *need to change* and vision proposed by the leadership are aligned and valid. The key is to avoid that resistance becomes an insurmountable impediment by hearing people out.

### Organizational Cultures

Organizational cultures are hard to describe, but are often a major factor in if a change sticks and is sustainable in the long run. SO being keenly aware where a change might challenge the visible or hidden parts of an organizational culture is paramount. On the other hand acting along the established norms and values and using the existing rituals and symbols to bring a change about is of much help. 

## Now what? 

The seven factors are of course not a traditional checklist to be checked of once and then its done. Rather they give a hint to reflect better about a change in process and help preparing the next move. The factors are closely linked and influenced by each others so adapting one will usually have an effect on the others. Changing the formulation of the *need for change* might have dramatic impact on how what kind *resistance* one encounters. Improving the *ability to change* might bring about a shift in the *corporate culture* which in turn might make different people eligible for *leadership* positions.
