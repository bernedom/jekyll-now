**Change is everywhere in modern organizations!** Agile transformations, digitalization, new tools, new technology, new methods, new processes, new customers. Live in modern companies is signified by fast and frequent changes. Those organizations that find it easy to change succeed, the others suffer. 
While the stories of failed transformations and changes are manifold there are organizations who successfully change seemingly without all the pain usually associated with it. 

## What makes a change successful?

Successful changes are 

* **target-oriented**: They have an explicit and often measureable target state
* **act where they should and how they should**: Consequently the side-effects are minimal
* **sustainable**: The effects are long-lansting and here to stay without burning out the people involved
* **accepted in the urgency**: The affected people understand that this change has to happen now
* **accepted in how they are brought about**: People understand the process on how this change is being enacted
* **experienced positively and actively supported by the affected**: People change willingly and actively contribute to bring the change about

## The 7 factors for success

* **Need for change**
* **Leadership and vision**
* **Support and reflection**
* **Ability and will to change**
* **Approach suited to complex problems**
* **Resistance**
* **Organizational cultures**
