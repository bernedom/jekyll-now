**Change is everywhere in modern organizations!** Agile transformations, digitalization, new tools, new technology, new methods, new processes, new customers. Live in modern companies is signified by fast and frequent changes. Those organizations that find it easy to change succeed, the others suffer. 
While the stories of failed transformations and changes are manifold there are organizations who successfully change seemingly without all the pain usually associated with it. 

## What makes a change successful?

Successful changes are 

* **target-oriented**: They have an explicit and often measureable target state
* **act where they should and how they should**: Consequently the side-effects are minimal
* **sustainable**: The effects are long-lansting and here to stay without burning out the people involved
* **accepted in the urgency**: The affected people understand that this change has to happen now
* **accepted in how they are brought about**: People understand the process on how this change is being enacted
* **experienced positively and actively supported by the affected**: People change willingly and actively contribute to bring the change about

## The 7 factors for success

* **Need for change**
* **Leadership and vision**
* **Support and reflection**
* **Ability and will to change**
* **Approach suited to complex problems**
* **Resistance**
* **Organizational cultures**

### Need for change

Formulating the need for change as actual state versus target state is the central anchoring point for any change. Being able to formulate this as explicitly as possible is necessary as only this can bring justification about the coming change. The "Why?" are we changing is much more an important question to answer than the "what" or "how" are we changing. It is important that here the *problem* that one wants to solve is described and not a preliminary solution. 
Also focusing on the root causes of a problem and not just the symptoms is very important here or else the effects might either be temporary or one might even end up in a situation worse than before.   

### Leadership and vision

The task of the leaders of any change is to draw a [tangible vision]({{site.base_url}}/a-good-product-vision) out of the *need for change*. They might not yet know the way to the target state, but they can illustrate how a desired target state might look and feel like. Strong communication and guidance towards this vision is a must for any leadership group.  
The leadership has to be explicitly defined so people should be able to put names of actual people to it. This can either be a single person or a small group of persons, but the group should not be too large. 

### Support and Reflection

The *need for change* and an appropriate and competent *leadership* are building the content authority of the change. In order to support facilitating the change a coach or supporter that is not directly affected by the change is a must. This allows the leadership to focus on the content instead of facilitation and provides an unbiased point for reflection. This can be external coaches but this does not have to be always the case. It is however important that whoever fills the role of the change coach is visible and accessible to the people affected by the change. 

### Ability to change

If the *need for change* is one side o the coin, the *ability and will to change* is the other. Before a change can be enacted it might be necessary to build up any skills needed for it first. This might take the form of special training for a tool or method. Closely related to the ability to change is having the will to change. The lack of will to change might have many causes and frequent and bidirectional communication by the leaders is necessary to address any concerns. 

### Approach suited to complex problems 

Organizational changes are complex problems, so while cause and effect might be observable in a retrospective, they are usually not fully predictable. As such an iterative, exploratory approach is a must. Small and fast iterations of hypothesis - verification - adaptation are a must. As such an organization will have to first leave the status as is and overcome any complacency, then enact the change - which is usually where things get tough and tedious - and then find stability again. The faster and more lightweight these cycles are the easier the change will feel. 

### Resistance to change

As opposition to the *ability to change* there is resistance to change. Encountering active resistance means that the change is heard and felt, which is a good thing. The lack of any resistance might be a hint that the change is either not having an effect, is stalled or is affecting at the wrong place. 
Of course any resistance has to be taken seriously and should be a welcome challenge to check if the *need to change* and vision proposed by the leadership are aligned and valid. 

### Organizational Cultures

Organizational cultures are hard to describe, but are often a major factor in if a change sticks and is sustainable in the long run. SO being keenly aware where a change might challenge the visible or hidden parts of an organizational culture is paramount. On the other hand acting along the established norms and values and using the existing rituals and symbols to bring a change about is of much help. 

## Now what? 

The seven factors are of course not a traditional checklist to be checked of once and then its done. Rather they give a hint to reflect better about a change in process and help preparing the next move. The factors are closely linked and influenced by each others so adapting one will usually have an effect on the others. Changing the formulation of the *need for change* might have dramatic impact on how what kind *resistance* one encounters. Improving the *ability to change* might bring about a shift in the *corporate culture* which in turn might make different people eligible for *leadership* positions.
