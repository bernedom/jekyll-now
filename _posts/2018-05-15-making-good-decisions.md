**How good are your decisions?** - Every day we decide a lot of things small and big. In our professional setting we often have clear deciders, wheter this is a senior subject matter expert, the traditional "boss" or some collaborative process in an emporwered team does not really matter. Fact ist as contrary to our private live in business we often have to make decisions more explicit and often have to document them, for instance in the form of meeting minutes. Some people are good at deciding, others find it very hard. 

Generally I experience two types of deciders. The ones who are most happy once a decision is done so they decide fast and early and others who try to analyze as much as possible before deciding as late as possible. Both have their merits and drawbacks. The quick deciders often have to readjust or even revert decisions because they lacked part of the context surrounding the matter to be decided on. The careful analysts sometimes miss the opportunity for a decision and are often seen as not deciding at all.  

But no matter what type of decider you have on your hand, there are certain qualities which make good decisions. And by good I don't necessarily mean that the outcome of the decision. i.e. being right or wrong, but how valuable taking the decsision was in the first place. Good decisions are explicit and well understood by the peolple involved and even if not everybody agrees there is at least consent to stick with the decision (for now). Bad decisions are fuzzy, heavily disputed and not followed by the people. Sometimes it is even worse that these decisions are even invisible. By invisible I mean that people are not even sure wheter a decision was taken or not, so people fail to act on it or act too early and possibly in a wrong direction. 

To be good at making decisions you have to be aware what kind of decision-making is happening. Are you doing the more
