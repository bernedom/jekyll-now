**There is nothing worse than stories left untold. ** Ever been in a team where some things hover in the "todo" column of your task board? Not quite important that they get done, but not as trivial that these items or stories[^1] just can be discarded? All these things that "should be done soon", yet nobody ever does them and also nobody dares to discard them. It happens in the best teams, but there is a way out of it. "Story ownership" is a practice set up to combat this situation and strengthen decentralized decision making as well.  

# Story ownership

The principle of story ownerships is simple:

1. Each story gets an owner assigned but this ownership has to be taken up voluntarily
1. The goal and responsibility of an 'owner' of a story is to get that thing completed as soon as possible while still respecting any given quality standards and team-internal processes
1. Ownership can be transfered in agreement between people 
1. Stories who do not get a distinct owner for a long time are discarded

Being the owner of the story does not necessarily mean that, that person necessarily has to implement that item themselves. Any member of a team can take ownership, not just the product owner (if you're doing scrum) or the requirements engineer. In fact the more people are willing to take ownership over stories the better as it reduces dependency on single persons. 
As a rule of thumb I say whoever adds an item to the board or system which is used to track the backlog gets the ownership. If the story is added by an outsider of the team a good strategy is to make the person who talked with the customer about that item the owner. 

Ownership has to be taken voluntarily and this also counts when handing over ownership. As ownership comes with a certain degree of commitment to get the story done, just assigning it to someone usually might not create the necessary driving force within that person to motivate them to push that story further on. 

Being the owner grants quite some power, but it does not mean that the person becomes an absolutistic ruler about how this is going to be done. Getting stories done should still follow any team interal processes and it should be in the owners interest to work as transparently as possible. 

If a story cannot find an owner for some time, this is a hint that either the story is not as important as we thought or that there is content missing within the story. In either case, discuss this and try to find an owner, if it is unsolveable for some time: remove it from the board. 
Not being able to find an owner for a story who is willing to push it is a very strong sign that people in your team do not understand the "why do we want to do this" of the story. 

# Ownership overload and orphaned stories

Distributing the responsibility of getting stories done in such a way of course has some possible pitfalls as well. As each person only can manage very few concurrent things, limiting the number of actively owner stories for each person is a good thing. The exact number of concurrently owned stories might vary from person to person, but generally the fewer the better to allow as much focus as possible. A good guideline is if a person needs to write down what story that person owns it's too many.
Essentially the amount of stories that are actively owned by people should correspiond to whatever the throughput of stories of your team is. Each owner should be able to have a more or less reliable prediction on when his stories will be started. This should align with your work in progress limit in such a sense that the number of currently owned, but not worked on stories is not much larger than whatever you plan to tackle next. 

I generally advice to have no or at least very few stories which do not have a clear owner. Having too many non-owned stories is a good sign that your backlog is too long and needs cleaning up. My experience is that it is much harder to find an owner for an old, existing item than for a new one so any story that does not quickly get an owner has a high chance to become stale. 

# Simple but not easy

As simple as the concept of story ownership is, pulling it off needs some training. In order to make it work a team should already have established a solid and good communication culture or you run the risk of creating silos of people working side-by-side instead of collaborating on the tasks at hand. Also it's members should be comfortable with making decisions and the team should have an agreement and awareness on [how they make decisions]({{site.baseurl}}/making-good-decisions/). If the team has specialized roles such as a PO or a Scrum Master, make sure that the people filling these roles are in the ownership-process as well.
