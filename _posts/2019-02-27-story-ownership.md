**There is nothing worse than stories left untold. ** Ever been in a team where some things hover in the "todo" column of your task board? Not quite important that they get done, but not as trivial that these items or stories[^1] just can be discarded? All these things that "should be done soon", yet nobody ever does them and also nobody dares to discard them. It happens in the best teams, but there is a way out of it. A set of principles which I call "Story ownership" for the lack of a better word. 

# Story ownership

The principle of story ownerships is acutally quite simple, **each story gets an owner assigned and the goal and responsibility of an 'owner' of a story is to get that thing completed as soon as possible**. Of course still respecting any given quality standards, processes and other constraints a team operates under. Being the owner of the story does not necessarily mean that, that person necessarily has to implement that item themselves. Any member of a team can take ownership, not just the product owner (if you're doing scrum) or the requirements engineer. 

As a rule of thumb I say whoever adds an item to the board or system which is used to track the backlog gets the ownership. If it is added by an outsider of the team a good strategy is to make the person who talked with the customer about that item the owner. 

Ownership can be handed to another person - even temporarily - if there is an agreement between the two people. If a story cannot find an owner for some time, this is a hint that either the story is not as importatnt as thought or that there is something wrong with the story. In either case, discuss this and try to find an owner, if it is unsolveable: remove it from the board. 

# How do I juggle my owned stories

 



- Each story has an owner
- the owners responsibility is to move the sotry as fast as possible to done (given the agreed quality statndard)
- transfer ownership
- discarding stories - in agreement, if ownership cannot be transfered
- own some but not too many
- requires maturity of a team and good, decentralized decision processes -- Advice process

[^1]: I use the word "story" here, but I essentially means any kind of backlog item.
