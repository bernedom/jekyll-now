**Iterate fast and often to make better products.** A sentence that rings true not just when developing software but also when working close or together with hardware development. With the advento if the IoT and fully automated Industry 4.0 integrated development between hardware and software becomes more prominent again. But reality is often that software development and hardware development fail to work effectively together and because of this struggle with creating good products fast. 

There are a lot of machines and products out there that started with good intentions and even sport brilliant design and technical excellence in some parts but as a whole just do not feel well thought through. The amounts of hacks that software-developers have to do to work around a shortcoming of the hardwaee supported is amazing. Or on the other hand hardware that is engineered so well that the software fails to use it's power is also something I encounter frequently. The reason is that often hardware and software development are held completely apart, except by a few points where specifications are exchanged in an often complicated handover process. But is does not have to be that way. 

By creating a good setup of the development teams, structured and fast prototyping and by involving the customer or end user early on this problems can be almost eliminated. 

## Team setup

Oftentimes ther is one hardware team working with one software team working with one electronics team and so on... While this appears to bundle the most skill in one place a much better alternative is to organize teams so that they contain all skills necessary for developing the project. And by team I mean people working together daily on the same product. collocated if possible, at least in close contact by skype, slack or whatever communication app you prefer. All those engineers should work and communicate together and share each others problems and successes. This has the benefit that people learn the "language" of each others special field and see how and why things are different in each others domain. This creates an alignment between the different disciplines but also let people help each other out.  
 
As an addition I am convinced that this let's you produce better products with less manpower, but this is more a side effect.
