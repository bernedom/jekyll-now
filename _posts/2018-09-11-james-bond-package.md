**The core capital of modern companies are their employees**. Especially for the companies operating in areas that require highly trained and motivated people with a high degree on initiative. A lot of tech companies, especially if they are specializing in writing software, fit perfectly into that scheme. The combination of skill, motivation, alignment and initiative is what I like to call the **James Bond Package**. All these traits and a good measure of social skills make 007 such a successful agile problem solver.

# 007: an agile problem solver

In his role as a secret agent, James Bond is a problem solver for the British secret service. In fact in "License to kill" 007 explicitly states that he is a problem solver, or rather a problem eliminator in that particular case. But on a closer look this is exactly what James Bond does. Most Bond movies follow the same pattern: Bond is called to London to get briefed over the newest crisis. He then jets around the world to gather more information and possibly charm or beat up a few baddies until he reveals the evil plot of the master villain (which he then usually disposes of). 

But on a closer look his approach resembles very much an agile approach in software engineering. Most of the time he has a quite clear mission statement, but the execution of how this mission is fulfilled is entirely with James Bond. Now if you replace "mission statement" with "product vision" and "James Bond" with cross-functional, empowered team we're very close to the setup of agile teams. 

And like in software development James Bond usually only has a fragment of the full picture defined at the beginning of the movie and he uncovers more and more information that defines the execution of his plan as he goes along. All the while the desired outcome of his mission remains quite static, although details might vary. This uncovering of more details of the evil plot also forces James Bond to frequently adapt his tactics to new situations, something the famous spy is an expert on. He might plan to charge into the villains mountain-resort with his gun drawn, only to find out that his charming attitude and social skills might be the better alternative here. 

What makes James Bond also very similar to how a proper agile team operates is that he works with a certain empowerment. 007 does not need to call his boss M to ask permission to fly around the world to sneak into the villains lair. He just does it and gets the necessary backing from his superiors. Of course there are a few mission constraints, such as not making the whole affair public, but within these boundaries James Bond retains the full authority over *how* his mission is executed. 

# The James Bond Package

All this sounds very much familiar to how we want our agile teams to solve the problems we face during product development. And if we look a bit closer we see that James Bond is: 
 * Well trained and educated
 * Motivated
 * Works autonomous
 * A creative problem solver 
 * Self-reliant
 * Well connected - even among his adversaries
 * Loyal
 * Employed for a long time

**This reads almost like a job advertisement for a (software) engineering position**. Nothing wrong with that, it is actually what we expect from our employees. In an agile culture it is not just technical excellence that we need but also high initiative and self reliance. 

James Bond as an expert problem solver brings possesses all of these (and many more) traits. The most obvious of all is that James Bond is highly skilled and well trained. From flying fighter jets, over fencing to socializing over a high-stake round of poker, James Bond can do it. One could see him as a subject matter expert on covert espionage or similar to a typical knowledge worker. Of course James Bond was not just born with these skills, but received a good education and further training by the British Navy and later the Secret Service. An important thing to note is that this training still goes on even after years of service. The James Bond of the 60ies probably would be utterly confused with modern computers, if he had not been trained on the newest technology.

It is never quite revealed why James Bond is so highly motivated to do his job and why he - as a descendant of Scottish heritage - is so fiercely loyal to Great Britain. Nevertheless this is a crucial factor in helping James Bond to top performance as it helps him to go out of the was of ordinary people to solve the problem. Without that motivation and loyalty it is doubtful that he would put his life in danger for his mission. While we do not expect our engineers to put their life at stake for our projects we would nevertheless have them motivated towards our goal and not just following orders because they have to. As the problems in software engineering often are complicated bordering on the complex we need people to think out of the box and be motivated to search for solutions despite it being hard or despite failing to resolve an issue on the first try. 

It is also motivation that helps people to display autonomy and high initiative to solve problems. James Bond shows both of these traits repeatedly by not asking for permission or guidance to go to the next step of his mission, but just doing it and knowing that this is OK. With the fast moving environments in agile development we face similar situations where circumstances and constraints might change and we want to act fast. Asking for permission of our bosses is a sure way to slow us down, so we need people who are confident in their abilities to make decisions locally and stick up for them. Imagine if James Bond would phone M every time he has to do a hard decision in the field, the villains probably would run circles around him and M probably would drown in phone calls of 00-agents from around the world. 

Though James Bond is self-reliant and perfectly capable of beating up or cheating villains on his own, he sometimes seeks help from others. Interestingly these are usually people from outside of MI-6 such as Felix Leitner from the CIA or some shady Russian ex-KGB-gangsters. Sometimes it is even a former henchman of his adversaries that help him out of a tight situation or supply the critical piece of information. Being well connected helps tremendously in many aspects, sometimes just being able to know that someone knows the situation you are in helps already with solving it. 

# The James Bond Package in reality

As appealing as the James Bond package is, can we transfer it from Hollywood to reality? Though it is unrealistic that we are able to hire or even build up a single James Bond we can substitute him with **cross-functional, empowered teams**. Not every single team member has to be an expert in all the problem-solving skills needed to save the world if they work together. By having people with complementing and overlapping skill-sets we can get very close to what James Bond can do. However there are some key attributes such as motivation and a sense for autonomy which should be shared with all team members and this is probably the hardest part, but by coaching and enabling people even this can be achieved with a bit of time.
