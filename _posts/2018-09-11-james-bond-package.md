title: "The James Bond Package - an agile skill- and mindset"
---

**The core capital of modern companies are their employees**. Especially for the companies operating in areas that require highly trained and motivated people with a high degree on initiative. A lot of tech companies, especially if they are specializing in writing software, fit perfectly into that scheme. The combination of skill, motivation, alignment and initiative is what I like to call the "James Bond" package. The most famous of all secret agents possesses all these traits and a good measure of social skills, which is why he is so successful in saving the world. 

# 007: an agile problem solver

In his role as a secret agent, James Bond is a problem solver for the british secret service. In fact in "Licence to kill" 007 explicitely states that he is a problem solver, or rather a problem eliminator in that particular case. But on a closer look this is exactly what James Bond does. Most Bond movies follow the same pattern: Bond is called to London to get briefed over the newest crisis. He then jets around the world to gather more information and possbily charm or beat up a few badies until he reveals the evil plot of the master villain (which he then ususally disposes of). 

But on a closer look his approach resembles very much an agile approach in software engineering. Most of the time he has a quite clear mission statement, but the execution of how this mission is fullfilled is entirely with James Bond. Now if you replace "mission statement" with "product vision" and "James Bond" with crossfunctional, empowered team we're very close to the setup of agile teams. 

And like in software development James Bond usually only has a fragment of the full picture defined at the beginning of the movie and he uncovers more and more information that defines the execution of his plan as he goes along. All the while the desired outcome of his mission remains quite static, although details might vary. This uncovering of more details of the evil plot also forces James Bond to frequently adap his tactics to new situations, something the famous spy is an expert on. He might plan to charge into the villains mountain-resort with his gun drawn, only to find out that his charming attitude and social skills might be the better alternative here. 

What makes James Bond also very similar to how a proper agile team operates is that he works with a certain empowerement. 007 does not need to call his boss M to ask permission to fly aorund the world to sneak into the villains lair. He just does it and gets the necessary backing from his superiors. Of course there are a few mission constraints, such as not making the whole affair public, but within these boundaries James Bond retains the full authority over *how* his mission is executed. 

All this sounds very much familiar to how we want our agile teams to solve the problems we face during product development. pl

# The James Bond Package

James Bond is: 
 * Well trained and educated
 * Motivated
 * Works autonomous
 * A creative problem solver 
 * Self-reliant
 * Well connected - even among his adversaries
 * Loyal
 * Employed for a long time

Sounds familiar? This reads almost like the typical job advertisement for a (software) engineering position in an agile company.  


In order to be able to solve his mission in an empowered way James Bond has to bring a few traits with him. The most obvious of all is that James Bond is highly skilled and well trained. From flying fighter jets, over fencing to socializing over a high-stake round of poker, James Bond can do it. One could see him as a subject matter expert on covert espionage or similar to a typical knowledge worker. Of course James Bond was not just born with these skills, but received a good education and further training by the British Navy and later the secret service. 

The „James-Bond-Package“
Well trained and skilled
Motivated
High initiative and self reliance
Creative problem solver
Well connected – also with his adversaries
Loyal 
Employed for a long time


James Bond – More than a man
"Just" a role
Role-Title "00" 
Developed and refined since the 60ies 
Every James Bond has his own personality and style



007 as an (agile) problem solver
Rarely has the full picture from the beginning
Keeps his mission in focus
Reprioritizes his tactis frequently
Chooses the apropriate course of action and tools depending on the situation 
Works autonomous and aligned with the mission
