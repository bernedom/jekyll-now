**The core capital of modern companies are their employees**. Especially for the companies operating in areas that require highly trained and motivated people with a high degree on initiative. A lot of tech companies, especially if they are specializing in writing software, fit perfectly into that scheme. Having someone with the [skills and mentality of James Bond (see "The James Bond Package")](/james-bond-package/) in your company might help solving your problems. However getting James Bond to work for you and then be able to unlock his full potential needs some work on company culture. 

# The MI-6 operating model

James Bond works for the British Secret Service, often called MI-6. While this is a governmental service it bears close resemblance to a large, internationally operating company. MI-6 is organised in different sections responsible to run operations in different parts of the world and special branches such as the 00-branch, Q- and I-branch. Each branch has it's specially talented and skilled people with James Bond obvously being a member of the 00-branch. Branches are operating across all sections, in fact in many of the movies 007 is actively sent to cooperate with people from differnt sections. This sounds very much familiiar to a lot of matrix-organized companies I've seen in the last few years. 

The MI-6 is capable and required to work as an indepented organisation, despite being proabalby fed by taxpayers money. So like a company James Bonds employer has to be self-organized and to a degree self-sufficient in all aspects of running its own operations. Running this operations of course needs people orchestrating - managers - and people executing the work - such as the 00-agents. 

The operations displayed in the typical Bond-movie are very people driven as, like a lot of companies today, MI-6 relies on skilled and talented people such as James Bond to complete the work. There are of course technical gadgets and supporting infrastructures to get the job done, but the brunt of the work and creative problem solving has to be done by people.

What about stakeholders? Sure MI-6 has them as well, essentially it's stake-holders or useres are all the people benefitting from not having the world destroyed by a madman-billionaire or a secret crime syndicate. And if not the whole world is at stake, then there are at least some politicians or the british government as a whole who are very much interested in the outcome of James Bonds work. 

# Operating principles of MI-6

MI-6 relies very much on motivated, skilled people to do the work, so it had to adopt some operating principles that seem to be very atypical for government agencies and more at home in modern, people-centric companies. Saving the world is a high-stake job that is very demanding, so the British Secret Service goes to  great length to treat its workers well. This shows most obviously when James Bond is on a missions, as it's always made sure that he receives all the creature comforts he wants. Suites in the finest hotels around the world, luxury cars or money to spend on those expensive, custom-prepared martinis is the secret-agent equivalent of having freshly ground coffee, ergonomic chairs and good computing equipment for a software developer. Employees don't need to be pampered, but *creating a work environment that lets them focus on their work and helps them refilling their batteries once in a while is essential if people are expected to perform and stay motivated over time*. Allowing people to take a break from their high-stake work regularly is essential - even James Bond only goes on a mission every 2-3 years on average. This of course does not just mean slacking of on a beach, but can also mean just a break from the daily routine such as training or working on something else that is less strenous for a time. 

Taking care of MI-6's secret agents needs does not happen magically, but is done by people working in supporting branches. Everything James Bond needs on his missions is organised for him without question, it is just assumed that once he needs something he has good reasons for it. A very good mentality, that translates very well to an agile working mode. If the engineers say they need access to a certain software, this is very likely true. 
MI-6 gets even e step further on this. The supporting branches are proactively supporting their agents. For instance Q never asks what James Bond needs, but rather presents him with the gadgets that allow him to complete his mission - no negotiation about the budget involved. This works because the *supprting personell know the work of the agents very well*, sometimes even with hands-on experience such as moneypenny being handed over a sniper rifle and being sent to help James Bond in Skyfall. 

This working environment is a large part of the success of James Bond, as it helps him focussing his energy on the important tasks at hand. By stating its goal and intentions explicitely and pursuing them relentlessly MI-6 helps creating this focus. The mission of MI-6 is "We work overseas to help make the UK a safer and more prosperous place"; this quite explicit mission statement helps James Bond to reevaluate all his actions time and time again. Does stopping Mr. Goldfinger make the UK a safer and more prosperous place. No question about it. 
James Bonds missions are of course much more specific than just making the UK more safe, but they all tie very well into that goal. These explicit mission statements help James Bond to recognise the constraints of his missions as well. Having an explicitely - and an accepted - mission statement in a company helps people to align themselves to it, which is even more important if they work as independently as James Bond. Another important thing that once James Bond is sent on a mission the only thing that matters is that the mission is completed, the how takes second or even third place. It is also left entirely to the secret agents on what kind of solution they find to complete the mission, the result is what counts. 

# Trusts your agents

This focus on goals and giving James Bond the power to chose his methods based on his current situation highlights the core value of MI-6. **Trust in its well trained, highly skilled and motivated employees**. Having a high alignment in an organisation, a motivating work environment and the people to perform in it is all worthless if people are not given the freedom to solve problems as they see fit. James Bonds "license to kill" gives him great power but it is also trusted that he uses that power responsibly. James Bond does not need to ask for permission of his boss to burglar into the manison of the villain, because by the time he might get the official permission the oportunity to solve the problem might have passed. 

On the other hand James Bond can rely very much that his employee does not leave him hanging in the air if things go wrong. Even when in a tight spot such as in a secret prison somewhere in korea he knows that MI-6 will take action to get him out of there. 

This mutual trust between employee and company is what makes the different between being a successful, high performing secret agent - or software developer - or just another henchman of the villain.
