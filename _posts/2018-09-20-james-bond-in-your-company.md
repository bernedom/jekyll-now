**The core capital of modern companies are their employees**. Especially for the companies operating in areas that require highly trained and motivated people with a high degree on initiative. A lot of tech companies, especially if they are specializing in writing software, fit perfectly into that scheme. Having someone with the skills and mentality of James Bond in your company might help solving your problems. However getting James Bond to work for you and then be able to unlock his full potential needs some work on company culture. 

# The MI-6 operating model

James Bond works for the British Secret Service, often called MI-6. While this is a governmental service it bears close resemblance to a large, internationally operating company. MI-6 is organised in different sections responsible to run operations in different parts of the world and special branches such as the 00-branch, Q- and I-branch. Each branch has it's specially talented and skilled people with James Bond obvously being a member of the 00-branch. Branches are operating across all sections, in fact in many of the movies 007 is actively sent to cooperate with people from differnt sections. This sounds very much familiiar to a lot of matrix-organized companies I've seen in the last few years. 

The MI-6 is capable and required to work as an indepented organisation, despite being proabalby fed by taxpayers money. So like a company James Bonds employer has to be self-organized and to a degree self-sufficient in all aspects of running its own operations. Running this operations of course needs people orchestrating - managers - and people executing the work - such as the 00-agents. 

The operations displayed in the typical Bond-movie are very people driven as, like a lot of companies today, MI-6 relies on skilled and talented people such as James Bond to complete the work. There are of course technical gadgets and supporting infrastructures to get the job done, but the brunt of the work and creative problem solving has to be done by people.

What about stakeholders? Sure MI-6 has them as well, essentially it's stake-holders or useres are all the people benefitting from not having the world destroyed by a madman-billionaire or a secret crime syndicate. And if not the whole world is at stake, then there are at least some politicians or the british government as a whole who are very much interested in the outcome of James Bonds work. 

# Operating principles of MI-6

The reliance of MI-6 on motivated, skilled people to do the work needed MI-6 to adopt a very modern operating principles that seem to be very atypical for government agencies. As MI-6 relies on it's personell to do a good job it goes to great length of treating its workers well. This shows most obviously that when James Bond is on a mission MI-6 makes sure that he receives all the creature comforts he wants. Suites in the finest hotels around the world, luxury cars or money to spend on those expensive, custom-prepared martinis is the secret-agent equivalent of having freshly ground coffee, ergonomic chairs and good computing equipment for a software developer. Employees don't need to be pampered, but giving them access to a work environment that let's them focus on their work and helps them refilling their batteries after a particularly trying task is essential if people are expected to perform and stay motivated. Also allow people to take a break regularlay - even James Bond only goes on a mission every 2-3 years on average. 

The working enviroment that MI-6 creates is only part of the success of James Bond, it is also the relentless focus on the goals and achievements of MI-6 that helps James Bond to perform. The mission of MI-6 is "We work overseas to help make the UK a safer and more prosperous place.". This quite explicit mission statement helps James Bond to reevaluate all his actions time and time again. Does stopping Mr. Goldfinger make the UK a safer and more prosperous place. No question about it. 
James Bonds missions are of course much more specific than just making the UK more safe, but they all tie very well into that goal. And this explicit mission statement helps James Bond to recognise the constraints of his missions as well. Having an explicitely - and accepted - mission statement in a company helps people to align themselves to it, which is even more important if they work as independently as James Bond.
