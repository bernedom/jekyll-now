description: What agile backlogs are and what they are not
---

**Having a high-quality backlog is a cornerstone of agile development.** The backlog is a central part of agile software development. Wether you're doing Scrum, Kanban or any of the scaled agile approaches, virtually all methodologies have a backlog as the central artifact of storing upcoming and current work. Because of its central role, looking at how the backlog is handled is often my first approach when people ask me for help in "doing agile". 

Over the year I've seen a set of anti-patterns in handling backlogs emerging. One central aspect is of course having high quality items in there. This means that they are formulated well, concise, and above all that the dialog about the content of the item between all parties involved (PO, stakeholders and developers) has happened. But how is the backlog handled at all.

## Antipattern 1 - A long messy list

I favor running a lean approach in my software development efforts. Which means I just refine enough backlog items to the ready state to never run out of things to do, while rigorously tracking what the team tries to accomplish right now. The benefit is that we work on what we think will generate the most value from todays standpoint on. It also shortens the cycle time from story inception to delivery. This involves often quite a bit of conversations between the developers, the PO and even the stakeholders but it is a very effective way of delivering frequently what brings actual value to the product.

So in order to be lean the backlog has to be short. Ideally anybody on the team should be able to recall 80% of the items in the backlog at any time. Maybe not all the details, because this is why we write it down in the first place, but a rough idea what comes along in the future. Anything that is beyond that scope should be in the product vision or if needed in an [agile roadmap](https://dominikberner.ch/Agile-Roadmapping/). The backlog is a working document on which the team works every day. Everything that is not important for daily work that is in there is just a distraction. 

I nowadays are at the point where I like to have at most a few weeks of work in a backlog at any time. I frequently go over the backlogs I'm working at and try to put a date for further refinement on any item in the new column. Anything that the team can't put a date on is a possible candidate to throw away. If it is important the team should be willing to put in effort "now", else it is not important. 

## Antipattern 2 - Ideas instead of intents

A good backlog should contain mainly actionable intents not ideas. Often the tendency is to put anything that comes to mind into the backlog, because "we might do it later". This is actually not the worst idea, but the problems start if these "we will do it later" items start to clutter the backlog it will quickly become confusing. Also having an endless "todo" list in front is very demotivating, especially if most of the todos are very vague. Whatever is put into the backlog should be refined to a ready-to-do story as soon as possible. If there is lack of time, or lack of will to put a date when a story will be refined to an item this is an indicator that this idea is not as important right now as it might have been felt when it came up. Delete it - if it is really important it will either come up again. If in doubt make the sponsor of the idea responsible of bringing it up again at a later time. This even can be a customer. 

Have that conversation frequently "are we willing to put in effort here soon?". If the answer is no, discard the item. The goal is that the backlog is a valuable list containing only relevant items. This firstly removed the mental load of discussing things that *might* come up eventually over and over again and it gives the team and customers a certain reliability on what is going to be done. 

## Antipattern 2 - Tasks instead of outcomes

Another common mistake is to handle the backlog as a list of tasks, describing what to do instead of what the outcome of an item is. This often prematurely narrows down the solution options and curtails the discussion about what problem a software is going to solve. Knowing what problem the software solves is of much more value up front than knowing what to do. There is nothing more expensive than than doing the wrong thing right. 

A backlog is not a todo list for developers, it is a list of problems and intents the team is trying to solve. The backlog is a central piece aiding the communication between stakeholders, the PO and the developers. Putting only technical tasks in it, will make its contents often incomprehensible for the stakeholders or the PO, whereas putting the problem in will make the intended outcome of a feature more accessible for the developers who will have to do it. 

## Backlogs 

Handling backlogs is something a team has to train and it is well worth it. If I only get 5 minutes to talk to people who struggle with agility I often ask them about their backlog-handling and often can already point out some improvements. Cutting away the waste is the cornerstone of lean-agile development and this means knowing what will be valuable and being willing to do it. A well handled backlog is a great enabler for teams to create a constant value stream.
